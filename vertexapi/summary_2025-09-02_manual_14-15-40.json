We had Andma, the disaster management directive that came in yesterday with heavy machinery to clear out some of the road and the rubble to be able to support with access so that humanitarian actors like the Afghan Red Crescent Society can go and operate search and rescue operations, but unfortunately, it's extremely challenging,\" Nader said.\n\nShe added that while they wait for a full incident report from the organisation, it is \"absolutely likely that those [death toll] numbers would dramatically increase because we are not getting to the most remote villages as of yet\".\n\nAfghanistan has experienced devastating earthquakes in the past due to its location at the meeting point where the Indian and Eurasian plates converge."

The United States was the largest aid donor to Afghanistan until early 2025, when all but a sliver of funds were cancelled after President Donald Trump took office.\n\nIn June, the United Nations said it was drastically scaling back its global humanitarian aid plans due to the \"deepest funding cuts ever\".\n\n'Fear and tension'\n\nRelatively shallow quakes can cause more damage, especially since the majority of Afghans live in low-rise, mud-brick homes vulnerable to collapse.\n\n\"There is a lot of fear and tension... Children and women were screaming. We had never experienced anything like this in our lives,\" Ijaz Ulhaq Yaad, a member of the agricultural department in Nurgal told AFP.\n\nIn a post shared by the Vatican, Pope Leo XIV said he was \"deeply saddened by the significant loss of life\" caused by the quake.\n\nMany living in quake-hit villages were among the more than four million Afghans who have returned to the country from Iran and Pakistan in recent years.\n\nAfghanistan is frequently hit by earthquakes, especially in the Hindu Kush mountain range, near the junction of the Eurasia and India tectonic plates.\n\nIn October 2023, western Herat province was devastated by a 6.3-magnitude earthquake, which killed more than 1,500 people and damaged or destroyed more than 63,000 homes.\n\nA 5.9-magnitude quake struck the eastern province of Paktika in June 2022, killing more than 1,000 people and leaving tens of thousands homeless.\n\nRavaged by four decades of war, Afghanistan is already contending with a series of humanitarian crises.\n\nSince the return of the Taliban in 2021, foreign aid to Afghanistan has been slashed, undermining the impoverished nation's already hamstrung ability to respond to disasters.\n\nAround 85 per cent of the Afghan population lives on less than one dollar a day, according to the UN Development Programme. -- AFP"

      "body": "Gigante alimentar suíça avança para o terceiro líder num curto espaço de tempo.\n\nA Nestlé despediu o seu presidente executivo (CEO), Laurent Freixe, apenas um ano após a sua nomeação para o cargo, após um inquérito a uma \"relação romântica\", afastando assim o seu segundo director executivo no espaço de um ano e lançando a gigante suíça da indústria alimentar na sua mais profunda crise de liderança das últimas décadas.\n\nFreixe é agora substituído pelo responsável da Nespresso, Philipp Navratil, uma estrela em ascensão dentro da companhia, que no geral tem assistido a um abrandamento das vendas desde a pandemia. As acções da Nestlé caíram 1% após o anúncio da saída de Freixe, que acontece um ano depois da demissão do antecessor, Mark Schneider, por má performance.\n\nO afastamento de Freixe segue-se a uma investigação a uma relação íntima, não declarada, entre o executivo e uma pessoa directamente subordinada, o que constitui uma violação do código de conduta da empresa, anunciou a Nestlé na noite de segunda-feira. Tinha sido já anteriormente desencadeado um inquérito interno na sequência de uma queixa feita através de um canal da empresa. Essa primeira investigação interna não confirmou as suspeitas, e Freixe negou a relação. No entanto, queixas reiteradas de funcionários da empresa levaram a Nestlé a abrir um segundo inquérito, agora com o apoio de um escritório de advogados suíço, que acabou por confirmar a infracção.\n\nFreixe, que estava há 39 anos na Nestlé, não receberá qualquer compensação pelo seu despedimento.\n\n\"A perda de dois CEO e de um presidente do conselho de administração no espaço de um ano é algo de proporções históricas para a Nestlé\", disse à Reuters Ingo Speich, responsável de relações corporativas e sustentabilidade da Deka, um accionista de referência da Nestlé. \"O novo CEO terá de concertar o modelo de negócio e aumentar o volume de vendas. Precisará de alcançar melhores fusões e aquisições, e focar-se mais nos mercados emergentes\", considerou.\n\nO despedimento do veterano da Nestlé acontece um ano após a demissão de Schneidar e dois anos e meio depois de Paul Bulcke, líder histórico do conselho de administração, ter anunciado que sairá em 2026, dando forma assim a um dos períodos mais turbulentos dos 159 anos de história da empresa.\n\nNum curto comunicado, Bulcke agradeceu a Freixe pelos seus anos ao serviço da Nestlé, mas considerou que o seu afastamento era uma \"decisão necessária\".\n\nAs acções da Nestlé, um dos pilares da bolsa suíça, perderam quase um terço do seu valor ao longo dos últimos cinco anos, cotando aquém dos seus concorrentes europeus. A nomeação de Freixe não inverteu a tendência, com a empresa a desvalorizar 17% durante o seu mandato, desiludindo os investidores.\n\n\"O mercado não gostava particularmente de Freixe, e os objectivos de restruturação foram colocados na gaveta\", analisa Maurizio Porfiri, director de investimentos na Maverix. \"É necessário um reinício, e é tempo de um regresso à estabilidade na gestão desta empresa global\", disse à Reuters.\n\nO despedimento de Freixe foi notícia de primeira página na imprensa helvética, com o Neue Zuercher Zeitung a sublinhar que a Nestlé perdeu a sua \"estabilidade legendária\", na qual os CEO permaneciam no cargo por vários anos até assumir a presidência do conselho de administração.\n\nA generalidade dos analistas considera que o afastamento de Freixe não deverá sossegar os investidores, dado que se trata da segunda vez que a Nestlé nomeia um novo director executivo de forma apressada, sem ter conduzido um processo de substituição sólido, e uma vez que o novo CEO, Navratil, é conotado com a estratégia do antecessor."

A presença do líder da Coreia do Norte será a primeira oportunidade em que ele aparecerá ao lado de Xi e Putin no mesmo evento.\n\nEsta é a segunda viagem de Kim ao exterior em seis anos e o norte-coreano aparentemente viajou acompanhado por sua filha, Kim Ju Ae, segundo o Serviço Nacional de Inteligência da Coreia do Sul.\n\nFotos publicadas pela agência KCNA mostram o líder fumando um cigarro fora de seu trem verde-oliva, acompanhado pela ministra das Relações Exteriores, Choe Son Hui, e de seu estreito colaborador Jo Yong Won.\n\nEm outra imagem, ele aparece sorrindo em um luxuoso vagão revestido de madeira, diante de uma bandeira norte-coreana e do emblema nacional.\n\nA visita de Kim \"formaliza a relação trilateral China-Rússia-Coreia do Norte diante da opinião pública\", afirmou Soo Kim, consultora de riscos geopolíticos e ex-analista da CIA, à AFP.\n\nKim desfrutou de um breve período de diplomacia internacional de alto nível a partir de 2018, quando se reuniu em algumas ocasiões com o presidente dos Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, e com o então presidente da Coreia do Sul, Moon Jae-in.\n\nContudo, ele se afastou do cenário internacional após o fracasso de uma reunião de cúpula com Trump em Hanói, capital do Vietnã, em 2019.\n\nKim permaneceu na Coreia do Norte durante toda a pandemia de covid-19, mas se reuniu com Putin no extremo leste da Rússia em 2023.\n\nA segurança em Pequim foi reforçada consideravelmente antes do desfile. Soldados foram mobilizados nas pontes e nas esquinas das ruas.\n\nQuilômetros de barreiras metálicas foram posicionados ao longo das avenidas. Por toda cidade, instalações artísticas mostram flores e um emblema que mostra a Grande Muralha da China com a inscrição \"1945-2025\".\n\nMilhões de chineses morreram durante um prolongado conflito com o Império japonês nos anos 1930 e 1940, que se tornou parte do conflito mundial após o ataque de Tóquio a Pearl Harbor em 1941.\n\nAs autoridades não revelaram o armamento que será exibido no desfile, mas os analistas militares já identificaram novos sistemas, incluindo o que poderia ser uma gigantesca arma a laser.\n\nO evento de quarta-feira encerra uma semana diplomática muito intensa para Xi, que no domingo e segunda-feira recebeu na cidade portuária de Tianjin (norte) líderes de vários países para a reunião de cúpula da Organização para Cooperação de Xangai (OCX), para promover uma governança mundial alternativa.\n\nPequim e Moscou citam a OCX, que representa quase metade da população mundial e 23,5% do PIB do planeta, como uma alternativa à Otan.\n\nDurante o encontro, Xi criticou o \"comportamento intimidatório\" de certos países, em uma referência velada aos Estados Unidos, enquanto Putin defendeu a ofensiva da Rússia na Ucrânia e culpou o Ocidente por desencadear o conflito.\n\nOs dois líderes destacaram nesta terça-feira que as relações entre Rússia e China \"estão em um nível sem precedentes\"."

Es ist fünf Uhr Nachmittag, als der grün bemalte Zug in den ikonischen Hauptbahnhof Peking einfährt. Hinaus steigt Nordkoreas Machthaber Kim Jong Un, dem trotz der 20-stündigen Anreise die gute Laune ins Gesicht geschrieben steht. Sein kugelsicherer Privatzug ist zwar mit einer Durchschnittsgeschwindigkeit von 60 Kilometern pro Stunde ziemlich behäbig, aber dafür umso komfortabler: Die Wagons beheimaten geräumige Konferenzzimmer mit Plüschsofas, eine medizinische Notfalleinrichtung, und natürlich darf der nordkoreanische Parteivorsitzende überall nach Belieben qualmen.\n\nMan könnte den ersten Peking-Besuch von Kim seit 2019 also als triviale Angelegenheit abtun. Und in vielen südkoreanischen Medien wird auch genau dies getan: Da ist von Kims eigens angefertigter Zugtoilette die Rede, die verhindern soll, dass seine Exkremente nach draußen gelangen und dort von Geheimdiensten analysiert werden könnten. Auch wird der wahnsinnige Luxus des Machthabers in allen Details ausgeschmückt - etwa, dass sein Privatzug auch stets eine schwarze Mercedes-Limousine mit sich führt.\n\nDer Hintergrund von Kim Jong Uns Rückkehr auf die internationale Bühne ist ein ernster. Die Militärparade, der der nordkoreanische Führer am Mittwoch beiwohnen wird, markiert seine erste Teilnahme an einer multilateralen Veranstaltung seit seiner Amtsübernahme 2011. Und historische Dimensionen erhält seine Reise, wenn es - wie erwartet - zu einem Dreiergipfel mit Chinas Staatschef Xi Jinping und dem russischen Präsidenten Wladimir Putin kommen sollte. Dann nämlich wären die Staatsoberhäupter von Peking, Moskau und Pjöngjang erstmals seit 66 Jahren wieder vereint."

E é surpreendente como, anos depois, a vida pode fechar o círculo de maneira incrível\", disse o ator, conhecido mais pelos seus papéis em filmes de ação como \"Black Adam\" e os da saga \"Velocidade Furiosa\".\n\nAo ser questionado sobre esses filmes, verdadeiros sucessos de bilheteira, \"The Rock\" afirmou que fez \"esses filmes e apreciou-os\", mas tinha um \"desejo ardente\" de explorar outro género.\n\nAdmitiu que fez esses papéis por razões comerciais e que \"a bilheteira na nossa indústria é muito barulhenta, pode ser muito ressonante e empurrar-nos para uma categoria e encurralar-nos\".\n\n\"Percebi isso e fiz aqueles filmes... alguns foram muito bons e resultaram, e outros nem por isso\", confidenciou.\n\nE acrescentou: \"Muitas vezes é difícil, pelo menos para mim (...), saber do que se é capaz quando está categorizado em algo (...) e precisa-se que pessoas que ama e respeita, como a Emily e o Benny, digam: 'Tu consegues'\".\n\n\"Simplesmente tinha este desejo ardente e esta voz que dizia: 'Bem, e se? E se houver mais e se eu puder?'\"\n\nEm teoria, o papel em \"The Smashing Machine\" foi feito à medida. Mas Mark Kerr -- em contraste com muitos dos papéis anteriores de Johnson -- é uma personagem cheia de falhas e nuances, com uma relação por vezes tóxica com Dawn.\n\n\"O filme não é sobre lutas. É uma história de amor entre Mark e Dawn e a sua relação\", disse Johnson, revelando ainda que teve de ganhar massa muscular para o papel a pedido de Safdie.\n\nNa sua crítica, a bíblia da indústria Variety chamou a Johnson uma \"revelação\", acrescentando que \"parece um novo ator\".\n\nDescrevendo a antestreia noutro artigo, a revista disse que o gigantesco ator \"soluçava incontrolavelmente enquanto a plateia no Lido irrompia numa ovação de pé de 15 minutos, uma das mais longas do festival deste ano até agora\". O mesmo aconteceu com o realizador e o próprio Kerr, presente na sala.\n\nA Variety descreveu o evento como o \"mais emocionante\" no festival \"desde que Brendan Fraser caiu em lágrimas, há quatro anos, ao lançar a sua campanha para os Óscares por 'A Baleia'\".\n\nSeyfried em transe\n\nPor sua vez, a proposta da realizadora norueguesa Mona Fastvold transporta o público para o século XVIII, para mostrar os primórdios do movimento religioso conhecido como \"Shakers\", famoso pelas orações durante as quais os fiéis entravam em transe e agitavam o corpo.\n\nAmanda Seyfried (\"Mean Girls\", \"Mank\") dá vida a Anne Lee, uma britânica de Manchester que, devastada pela perda de quatro filhos ainda bebés, decide renunciar completamente ao sexo e dedicar-se inteiramente à religião.\n\nSegundo a atriz, interpretar esta personagem, que carrega tanto sofrimento, foi \"difícil\" e também \"fantástico\", até \"terapêutico\", declarou na conferência de imprensa.\n\nO movimento fundado por Lee ganha adeptos que se reconciliam com Deus após terem pecado, sacudindo vigorosamente o corpo, num filme de época que namora com o género musical, onde os atores interpretam várias canções inspiradas nos hinos reais entoados na época.\n\nA realizadora disse que não concordava com todas as suas ideias, mas \"na história de Anne Lee, o que mais me chamou atenção é a maneira como ela lidera (...) com empatia e gentileza\" para \"criar um espaço onde todos fossem iguais, homens, mulheres, negros\". Mona Fastvold escreveu o argumento com o seu marido, o cineasta Brady Corbet, cujo filme \"O Brutalista\" usou Veneza como rampa de lançamento para culminar na conquista de três Óscares, incluindo o de Melhor Ator para Adrien Brody.\n\nTambém a realizadora abraçou emocionada Amanda Seyfried durante uma longa ovação de pé no final da projeção."

Anwohner benachbarter Dörfer hätten Rettungsteams gebildet.\n\nBis Dienstagnachmittag seien neun Leichen geborgen worden, sagte der Koordinator eines örtlichen Notfallrats dem Sender Asharq.

Unter den Toten befänden sich auch mehr als 450 Vertriebene, die nach Ausbruch des Krieges 2023 nach Tarsin geflohen waren.\n\nAl-Nur zufolge leben Tausende weitere Menschen in den umliegenden Dörfern nun in Angst vor weiteren Erdrutschen, sollten die schweren Regenfälle anhalten. Er forderte Hilfe von den Vereinten Nationen und Hilfsorganisationen sowie einen Evakuierungsplan und Notunterkünfte für die gefährdeten Menschen.\n\nDer Gouverneur der Region Darfur, Minni Minnawi, schrieb auf X von \"einer humanitären Tragödie, die über die Grenzen der Region hinausgeht, da wir durch eine verheerende Naturkatastrophe einen Großteil unserer Bevölkerung verloren haben\". Auch er bat dringend um Hilfe von internationalen humanitären Organisationen.\n\nIm Sudan tobt seit 2023 ein schwerer Bürgerkrieg zwischen der Armee und der paramilitärischen Rebellengruppe Rapid Support Forces, die mittlerweile einen großen Teil Darfurs unter ihrer Kontrolle hat. Daneben sind in der Region noch andere Rebellengruppen aktiv, darunter die SLM/A, die aus früheren Konflikten hervorgegangen war."

      "body": "BERLIN - Erik Ten Hag's dismissal at Bayer Leverkusen this Monday didn't come as a surprise.\n\nA wave of reports detailing major disagreements between the Dutch coach, his team, and the club's leaders over the past few days had somehow set the stage for a split that became a record in the German league's history.\n\nAhead of Leverkusen's afternoon practice and after only two matches in the 2025-26 season, the 2024 Bundesliga champions and German Cup winners made the earliest coaching change in league history.\n\nWhile CEO Simon Rolfes called the step painful and far from \"what we wanted,\" media reports indicate that the former Ajax and United coach failed to set up a fruitful connection to his team and the club's leaders.\n\n\"The past weeks have demonstrated that restructuring a successful team can't be achieved in this cast,\" Rolfes said.\n\nWith a contract until 2027, the 55-year-old failed to continue his predecessor Xabi Alonso's successful run. The Spanish star coach left for Real Madrid after achieving unprecedented success in two years, leading the team to its first league title.\n\nAfter a bumpy pre-season preparation, turmoil grew as the previous season's second-placed team lost its league opener to Hoffenheim 2-1, followed by a disappointing 3-3 draw against the bottom side of Bremen.\n\nALSO READ: Erik ten Hag named new Bayer Leverkusen head coach\n\nThe sports magazine Kicker wrote about Ten Hag having gambled away his credit line as he started to criticize his newly assembled squad in public.\n\nDespite the club's efforts to rebuild the squad, with the departure of 12 players including Florian Wirtz, Jeremie Frimpong (LFC), Granit Xhaka (Sunderland), and Jonathan Tah (Bayern), the Dutch called for new signings in several public statements.\n\nReports describe Ten Hag as \"a big misunderstanding\".\n\nThe first cracks emerged after the coach refused to try to keep team captain Xhaka. The Swiss international is said to have left when the new Leverkusen coach refused to see him as a team leader or include him in his plans.\n\nThe new team captain, German international Robert Andrich, had rung alarm bells after the recent games.\n\nAndrich discussed a missing hierarchy, where \"everyone is busy with himself and only plays for himself.\"\n\nInevitable team spirit is missing, the midfielder complained, while reports spoke of a problematic relationship between the coaching team and the players.\n\nAfter Leverkusen failed to sign their primary target, the Como coach and former Arsenal, Chelsea, and Barcelona midfielder Cesc Fabregas, the side turned to Ten Hag.\n\nUnlike former coach Alonso, who kept close ties with his players, Ten Hag's distant style wasn't well received during his two months in charge.\n\nREAD MORE: Real Madrid appoint Alonso as manager on three-year contract\n\nThe club is expected to find a new head coach before the next league game against Frankfurt on Sept 12."

This time, the focus will be on policies -- in particular security policy, said Zbigniew Bogucki, head of the chancellery of the president.\n\nSituated as it is on NATO's eastern flank -- and, therefore, on the front line in terms of the threat from Russia -- Poland does not rely solely on NATO's security guarantees, but also fosters a close, bilateral alliance with the USA.\n\nAt a time when Washington's interest in Europe is waning, Warsaw hopes to secure the ongoing support of the Americans through good personal contacts and generous arms purchases.\n\nPoland's new president intends to continue this policy, which his predecessor, Andrzej Duda, pursued for ten years.\n\nAbout 10,000 American soldiers are currently stationed in Poland.\n\nA US missile defense site for intercepting short-to-intermediate range ballistic missiles went into operation in Redzikowo in northern Poland in 2024.\n\nThe Polish army has -- or will soon have -- American Apache helicopters, Abrams tanks and HIMARS rocket launchers. Warsaw is also waiting to take delivery of 32 F-35 fighter jets.\n\nThe US administration's plans to reduce its military presence in Europe are causing alarm both within the Polish government and the opposition. So, any suggestion by Trump that Poland would be spared such a reduction would be a success for Nawrocki.\n\nThe US also plays a key role in Poland's energy security: Poland is turning to nuclear energy and its first nuclear power plant, which is due to go on-grid in 2036, will be built by the American company Westinghouse-Bechtel.\n\nThe conflict between President Nawrocki and the center-left government of Donald Tusk is casting a shadow over the president's trip.\n\nSince taking office four weeks ago, the president has vetoed seven government bills, including an extension of social welfare benefits for Ukrainian refugees in Poland.\n\nThis domestic dispute is now affecting the country's foreign policy.\n\nPrime Minister Tusk is of the opinion that the government sets out Poland's foreign policy and that the president merely represents the country abroad.\n\nThis is at odds with the way Nawrocki sees his role: He is pushing the concept of an \"active presidency\" and wants to shape politics in the country.\n\nThe Foreign Ministry sent a paper outlining the government's positions to the chancellery of the president by way of preparing Nawrocki for his trip to Washington.\n\nThe president's spokesperson Rafal Leskiewicz called the document \"embarrassing\" and \"lacking concrete information.\" He went on to say that the paper could be described as a \"joke.\"\n\nThe president knows what he has to say, added Marcin Przydacz, head of the president's International Policy Bureau.\n\nThe contents of the document have since found their way into the media.\n\nPolish newspapers have reported that the Foreign Ministry recommended that Nawrocki exercise \"particular caution\" on a number of subjects, including the digital tax and the regulation of social media.\n\nIt is unclear how the media got hold of the paper.\n\n\"This blunder puts Nawrocki in an unfortunate position,\" wrote the internet platform Onet.\n\n\"If I were president,\" posted Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski on X, \"I would find out who the idiot was [who leaked the document].\"\n\nIt is assumed that the leak came from the chancellery of the president.\n\nThe dispute before the president's Washington trip is just another chapter in the power struggle between Nawrocki and Tusk.\n\nThe president used his contacts in the US administration to prevent Tusk from taking part in a teleconference between several European heads of state and government and US President Trump on August 13 and to take Tusk's place instead.\n\nBecause of the dispute, neither the president nor the prime minister joined the delegation of European leaders who accompanied Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to Washington five days later.\n\nIt was announced on Tuesday that no representative of the Polish Foreign Ministry would accompany Nawrocki to Washington. The Polish Embassy in Washington has also been excluded from the visit.\n\nBut Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski was not to be deterred: He will fly to the US on Tuesday to meet US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n\nAlthough a new arrival on the global political stage, Nawrocki makes no bones of his international ambitions.\n\nIn Central and Eastern Europe in particular, he wants to call the tune when it comes to relations with the US, representing not only Poland, but also the entire region.\n\nLast Thursday, he met President of Lithuania Gitanas Nauseda, President of Estonia Alar Karis, President of Latvia Edgars Rinkevics and Prime Minister of Denmark Mette Frederiksen in Warsaw. Zelenskyy later joined the meeting by video.\n\nAfter the meeting, Marcin Przydacz, head of the president's International Policy Bureau, said that future peace in Ukraine must be \"maximally just\" and should not be viewed by Russia as a victory.\n\nRussia bears responsibility for the aggression, he said, and must \"feel the power of the West.\"\n\nWestern neighbor Germany does not feature in the new president's travel plans for the moment.\n\nAt the ceremony commemorating the 86th anniversary of the outbreak of World War II in Gdansk on Monday, Nawrocki made it clear that good relations with Germany depend on a solution to the question of war reparations for Poland."

      "body": "Chelsea's summer transfer window was busy from day one, but the biggest drama was saved until last.\n\nAs the Chelsea hierarchy sat down to watch the team host Fulham on Saturday afternoon, everything seemed to be under control. Essentially, all their incomings had been completed, while there were only a handful of outgoings left to sort out. That feeling of calm all changed when Liam Delap pulled up clutching the back of his right leg in the 12th minute. Soon after, the striker was substituted and headed straight down the tunnel to be assessed.\n\nUp in the VIP boxes at Stamford Bridge, a discussion was quickly held about what to do. Sources speaking anonymously to The Athletic to protect relationships reveal that a message was then sent to Chelsea's medical team to get Delap to the hospital for a scan immediately. Normally, clubs will opt to take a few days before conducting a first significant test on such an injury, and certainly don't feel the need to rush a player to the hospital over what was just a suspected hamstring strain. Such drastic action is usually reserved for much more serious issues. Given the ramifications for their forward line with the transfer deadline looming, Chelsea had no time to lose. There was one big question: what should they do about Nicolas Jackson?\n\nBy this stage, Jackson was already on a flight to Germany, having been given permission earlier that morning to have a medical at Bayern Munich in view of joining them on loan for €15million with an option to buy worth another €65m (plus a sell-on clause). This incident put all of that in doubt.\n\nChelsea knew they would not be able to get a completely accurate diagnosis of how bad Delap's issue was because it was so soon after it happened. However, they could get a gauge at least, and the decision makers were quickly informed that it was not looking good. This was going to be a minimum of six to eight weeks on the sidelines, possibly longer.\n\nAfter discussions were held between members of the recruitment team, ownership and head coach Enzo Maresca, the club got in contact with Bayern soon after the Fulham match had ended to inform them that Jackson was no longer available for loan under any conditions. Permission to undergo the medical was revoked, with Jackson and his representatives then called to deliver the bad news that the deal was off and he would be staying at Chelsea. The only way at this point it could be revived was if Bayern bought him outright, yet that was always unlikely to happen. Bayern wanted an initial loan to begin with as they did not have the funds for a transfer of this size now.\n\nThe turn of events prompted one of Jackson's close associates involved in the deal, Diomansy Kamara (Ali Barat is his official agent), to post a story soon after on his Instagram account which read: \"We are not going back. The plane doesn't go backwards.\" And he was true to his word; Jackson and his entourage remained in Munich in the hope that something could be resolved.\n\nFast forward 24 hours, and it still did not look likely, even though The Athletic reported on Sunday morning that Chelsea were looking at potential strikers to sign, one of them being Sporting CP attacker Conrad Harder. An enquiry to the club and player was made, but it went no further than that. Harder went on to join RB Leipzig.\n\nBayern Munich conceded the deal was off on Sunday evening and began looking at alternatives, one of whom was Atalanta's Ademola Lookman. So how did the situation change again for Jackson to end up posing for pictures in a Bayern shirt late on Monday with a switch secured?\n\nChelsea's decision to look into recalling teenage striker Marc Guiu from a season-long loan from Sunderland on Sunday offered Bayern encouragement to pick up the phone once again.\n\nChelsea had decided Guiu was the best option rather than buying or loaning someone else, and to get that sorted in case something with Jackson, who was also the subject of interest from three Premier League clubs, took place. There was no release clause for this window in the terms agreed with Sunderland earlier that month, while there would have been for January. Chelsea ended up having to agree to repay the loan fee they had charged Sunderland to get him back.\n\nDiscussions resumed with Bayern late Sunday and continued into Monday. Crucially, both parties were willing to compromise. Bayern were prepared to change the deal so that it would include a conditional obligation to buy next summer rather than just a simple option. With Jackson still in Germany and clearly still setting his sights on joining Bayern, Chelsea were also ready to negotiate, especially as they had now secured cover with Guiu.\n\nSoon after 3pm UK time, a new deal was struck worth a bit more than the first. The loan fee was now up to €16.5m, with the obligation staying at another €65m (plus sell-on clause). Getting all the paperwork signed off was not an issue, and late on Monday, the obligatory announcement on Bayern's official website was made with Jackson posing next to board member for sport Max Eberl and sporting director Christoph Freund. \"I'm really happy to now be part of this great club,\" Jackson said. \"Bayern is one of the best clubs in the world. I've got big goals and dreams here and will give my all to help Bayern win further titles.\"\n\nWhile all this took centre stage, there were other things Chelsea had to sort out. Defender Ben Chilwell was the subject of a loan offer from Everton, but ended up moving permanently to Strasbourg. The opportunity was partly opened up by Nottingham Forest signing Dilane Bakwa from Strasbourg on the same day. The Ligue 1 side's winger, Diego Moreira, can now move to the right flank, leaving space for Chilwell to operate on the left.\n\nDespite being for sale all summer, no offers came in on deadline day for Raheem Sterling. Defender Axel Disasi had loan bids from three Premier League clubs but did not want to go to any of them. Striker David Datro Fofana was close to securing a loan to a Championship side, but the paperwork was finished just too late by the lower division side, and it fell through.\n\nThe greatest regret within the confines of Chelsea though, was Tyrique George's move to Fulham, who first signalled their intent a month earlier, breaking down. A package worth £22m plus a sell-on clause was in place, yet fell through at the last moment. The academy graduate will now continue to be part of the senior set-up and also be named in Chelsea's Champions League squad for the group phase.\n\nAs for any arrivals, Facundo Buonanotte's loan move from Brighton & Hove Albion was officially announced, but that had been signed off on Friday. As The Athletic reported, there was no further attempt to buy Fermin Lopez from Barcelona.\n\nChelsea were in an upbeat mood after the window was shut, feeling that the squad is now better than the one that finished fourth in the Premier League last May. Six additions were made on top of Estevao Willian (May 2024) and Dario Essugo (March 2025), whose signings were secured in advance, plus the highly rated Andrey Santos is now involved after impressing on loan at Strasbourg. The club ignored interest from clubs in the Premier League, Europe and elsewhere for the Brazil midfielder.\n\nIncluding loans, the club offloaded over 20 players, and of these, only Noni Madueke, Jadon Sancho -- Chelsea pulled out of their obligation to buy from Manchester United after the end of his loan -- and Jackson were regulars under Maresca last season.\n\nAccording to Transfermarkt, Chelsea have raised (€332.25m) more than they spent (€328.16m). It means they have been able to add greater depth to the squad and make a lot of changes to the attack while still maintaining a positive transfer balance. This has obvious positive connotations in terms of the Premier League's profit and sustainability rules and UEFA's financial measures.\n\nChelsea's settlement agreement with UEFA after being found guilty of breaching their rules carried the threat of not being able to register new signings for the Champions League squad. It is more complicated than just a money in and out scenario, but Chelsea are now relaxed about the situation after the work they have done. Sources say if anyone is left out for the group phase, it will be for a different reason.\n\nSources at the club say no one is getting ahead of themselves and saying they must win the title this campaign. There is optimism, though, that Chelsea are now in a better position to compete for the Premier League for longer and end up closer to the top.\n\nAs for Jackson, he has an early chance to face Chelsea in Bayern's opening Champions League group game in a fortnight. Unlike in the Premier League, UEFA rules mean a loanee can play against their parent club. Score against them and the Senegal international will surely feel all the twists and turns over the last few days were worth it."

Both nations agreed to work towards border demarcation. The SCO declaration condemned the Pahalgam terror attack. India maintains its right to build relations with Taiwan. New Delhi signals strategic autonomy to Washington.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi met Chinese President Xi Jinping in Tianjin on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) leaders' summit on August 31. This is Modi's first visit to China since the Indian and Chinese troops clashed on the border in 2020.\n\nThrough this outreach, and during regular SCO ministerial interactions, New Delhi has made its red lines loud and clear to Beijing. The issue of the border has figured prominently in the discussions between Modi and Xi. Modi has pitched a stable relationship between the two nations based on 'mutual respect, mutual interest and mutual sensitivity'. He has underscored that peace along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) will have a bearing on the trajectory of the India-China relationship. While disengagement has taken place along the LAC in eastern Ladakh, de-escalation is yet to happen with approximately 50,000-60,000 troops are still deployed on either side of the LAC in the region.\n\nModi has pitched a stable relationship between the two nations based on 'mutual respect, mutual interest and mutual sensitivity'.\n\nIn August, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi was in New Delhi for the 24th round of Special Representatives talks. The SRs mechanism was set up in a 2003 agreement, and is mandated to look into ways to resolve the boundary question from a political perspective. During this sitting, it was resolved to set up an 'expert group' under the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on India-China Border Affairs to work out the feasibility of boundary delimitation in the border areas, and a 'working group' to advance effective border management to maintain peace along the LAC. During the meeting of defence ministers at the SCO in June, India's Defence Minister Rajnath Singh had told his counterpart that the two nations should work towards a permanent solution of border demarcation, and a structured roadmap of permanent engagement and de-escalation. Thus, the initiative to effectively manage the LAC and delineate the border, which has been a bone of contention, has gathered momentum.\n\nThe other issue that Modi raised with Xi was the issue of cross-border terrorism that has come to the forefront after the terrorist attack in Pahalgam on April 22 in which 26 people were gunned down. Indian representations during previous ministerial meets of SCO too have highlighted the issue. During the SCO meet in July, Foreign Minister S Jaishankar had reminded China that the prime objective of the multilateral grouping was to combat terrorism, separatism, and extremism. Banned Huawei satellite phones and encrypted apps were suspected to be aiding terrorists involved in the Pahalgam terror attack in communicating with their handlers across the border. Earlier, Beijing blocked moves to place Jaish-e-Mohammad's Rauf Asghar, Lashkar-e-Taiba's Sajid Mir and Abdur Rahman Makki on a UN sanctions list. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh had refused to endorse a joint statement at the SCO Defence Ministers' meeting in China in June, as India had been pushing for inclusion of tougher language on terrorism that reflected its position. This concerted effort seems to have borne fruit. The SCO declaration adopted at Tianjin stated that \"they expressed their deepest sympathy and condolences to the families of the dead and the wounded, and that the \"perpetrators, organisers and sponsors of such attacks must be brought to justice.\" The joint declaration added that \"The Member States, while reaffirming their firm commitment to the fight against terrorism, separatism, and extremism, stress the inadmissibility of attempts to use terrorist, separatist and extremist groups for mercenary purposes.\" This puts Pakistan on notice since Islamabad is known for the use of proxy terror groups, and the Pakistani Army has deep links with terrorist outfits.\n\nBanned Huawei satellite phones and encrypted apps were suspected to be aiding terrorists involved in the Pahalgam terror attack in communicating with their handlers across the border.\n\nLastly, the issue of Taiwan has come up prominently during previous interactions between the Indian and Chinese sides. New Delhi and Taipei have been assiduously fostering cooperation in science and technology. Foxconn Chairman and CEO Young Liu received India's third-highest civilian award on the Republic Day last year, and he later met Modi in New Delhi to discuss investment plans. During the media briefing after the Modi-Xi summit, the issue of Taiwan was raised. Rather than being on the defensive, New Delhi has steadfastly maintained that it was well within its rights to build relations with Taipei in economic, technological and cultural spheres, just like China-Taiwan dynamics in the same areas. Also, in maintaining that there was no change in its position on the Taiwan issue, this assertion is cryptic in itself, since India had not repeated that it commits to the notion of one-China. In fact, the late Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj had reminded her counterpart that if China did not adhere to a one-India policy, why should India want to affirm a one-China policy.\n\nWhile Modi asserted India's red lines to China during the Tianjin summit, it also sent out a message to the U.S. U.S. President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on Indian goods over its import of Russian oil. In Modi sharing a ride with Russian President Vladmir Putin, New Delhi has sent a message to Washington that it will double down on strategic autonomy, and will not back down.\n\nThis commentary originally appeared in Economic Times.\n\nThe views expressed above belong to the author(s).

      "body": "Tottenham bolstered their attack with the Deadline Day signing of Randal Kolo Muani, adding to the acquisition of Xavi Simons. These additions provide tactical flexibility and address key weaknesses in creating chances and midfield creativity.\n\nTottenham entered Deadline Day with a clear priority: bolstering their attack. After swift negotiations, the club secured the signing of French forward Randal Kolo Muani on a season-long loan from Paris Saint-Germain. This addition comes at a crucial time, providing much-needed depth up front amid concerns over Dominic Solanke's ankle injury.\n\nKolo Muani's arrival followed just two days after Tottenham's high-profile signing of Xavi Simons, who was warmly introduced to the fans at the north London stadium. The midfielder's move from RB Leipzig for nearly £52 million is seen as a major boost, expected to help address Spurs' creativity issues in the midfield, especially with Dejan Kulusevski and James Maddison sidelined through injury.\n\nHere's a closer look at three possible Tottenham lineups incorporating their two exciting new signings:\n\nKolo Muani and Simons Together as Attacking Threats\n\nTottenham's recent 1-0 loss to Bournemouth highlighted a key weakness: struggling to create meaningful chances despite dominating possession. The team controlled over 60% of the ball but lacked cutting-edge play in the final third, which ultimately cost them.\n\nSimons, operating as a No.10, could provide the much-needed creative spark, unlocking defenses with his flair and vision. Kolo Muani, capable of playing out wide, offers a more potent attacking option on the left wing than current choices. This deployment allows Richarlison to continue leading the line, where the Brazilian has been in impressive form this season.\n\nThe projected lineup in a 4-2-3-1 formation would be:\n\nVicario; Porro, Van de Ven, Romero; Spence; Palhinha, Sarr; Kudus, Simons, Kolo Muani; Richarlison\n\nSimons Shifted Wide to Support Midfield Stability\n\nAgainst tougher opponents, head coach Frank tends to rely on a hardworking three-man midfield trio: Rodrigo Bentancur, Joao Palhinha, and Pape Matar Sarr. This unit's relentless pressing has caused notable problems for top teams, including a key victory over Manchester City.\n\nIn such matches, Frank might preserve this midfield core while integrating Simons and Kolo Muani differently. Simons can take up a position on the left wing with freedom to drift inside, using his creative skills to influence the game. Meanwhile, Kolo Muani would lead the attack up front, playing in his preferred central striker role.\n\nThis 4-2-3-1 lineup might look like:\n\nVicario; Porro, Van de Ven, Romero; Spence; Palhinha, Bentancur; Kudus, Sarr, Simons; Kolo Muani\n\nAdopting a 3-5-2 Formation for Tactical Flexibility\n\nOn occasions like the UEFA Super Cup clash against PSG, Frank has experimented with a 3-5-2 system, which could provide fresh tactical flexibility. In this setup, Simons would operate deeper in a No.8 role, being the most advanced midfielder among a three-man midfield alongside Palhinha and Bentancur.\n\nThis positioning grants Simons the freedom to surge forward and link up with the front two strikers, injecting more dynamism into what can otherwise feel a conservative lineup. Both Simons and second striker Mohammed Kudus are prone to drifting wide, keeping opposition defenses guessing and creating space.\n\nKolo Muani would be positioned as the foremost attacker, tasked with holding up the ball and involving teammates like Simons and Kudus in attacking moves.\n\nThe 3-5-2 lineup could be structured as:\n\nVicario; Danso, Romero, Van de Ven; Porro, Palhinha, Bentancur, Simons, Spence; Kudus, Kolo Muani\n\nRead Full Article"

And if he played, he was going to be strong. We also knew that if he decided to do that, it was going to be a lot to try and juggle both.\n\n\"But they seem to have many plans in place. He's made his decision. He's decided that he has plenty of talent to replace him.\n\n\"I know Keegan well. He's a good friend of mine and I understand that he's going to bring a strong passion, he's going to try and get his troops pretty fired up.\"\n\nLuke Donald suggests who he thinks are favorites to win the Ryder Cup\n\nQuietly confident after their 2023 Rome victory, the visitors anticipate a difficult challenge at Bethpage Black, being aware that they are the away team and are facing quality opponents in New York\n\nThe hosts are expected to field a very strong team once again, with world number one Scottie Scheffler joined by fellow major winners Xander Schauffele and Bryson DeChambeau.\n\nSuggesting who he thinks are favourites to come out on top at Bethpage, Donald said:\n\n\"Obviously, on paper, they're very strong. That home advantage is pretty good. So I still do believe we are underdogs.\"\n\nGiven how little change there is from Europe's squad for Rome 2023 - a tournament they won comfortably - there is reason for optimism.\n\nFurthermore, strong team chemistry, both during play and off the course, is crucial for Ryder Cup success, and Team Europe have it."

      "body": "Ao longo da história, terremotos provocaram algumas das maiores tragédias já registradas no planeta, deixando centenas de milhares de mortos e destruindo cidades inteiras.\n\nEsses fenômenos naturais, quando atingem áreas povoadas, podem provocar efeitos devastadores, especialmente em regiões onde as construções não resistem à força dos abalos.\n\nEm 23 de janeiro de 1556, a região central da China foi cenário do que cientistas consideram o pior desastre natural já registrado. O terremoto de Shaanxi teria alcançado magnitude 8,3 na escala Richter e atingido oito províncias e 98 cidades. Algumas localidades perderam até 60% da população devido a soterramentos. A estimativa é de 830 mil mortos.\n\nNa madrugada de 27 de julho de 1976, um tremor de 7,5 graus atingiu a cidade de Tangshan, no nordeste da China. O abalo ocorreu durante a noite, quando a maioria da população estava em casa dormindo. O governo chinês registrou cerca de 250 mil mortos e 800 mil feridos, mas especialistas afirmam que o total de vítimas pode ter chegado a 650 mil.\n\nEm 26 de dezembro de 2004, um terremoto submarino de magnitude 9,1 no Oceano Índico gerou um dos maiores tsunamis já observados. Ondas gigantes atingiram Sumatra, na Indonésia, além de Sri Lanka, Índia, Somália, Mianmar, Malásia e Maldivas. O desastre deixou cerca de 228 mil mortos e entrou para a lista dos maiores abalos já registrados por sismógrafos.\n\nNo dia 12 de janeiro de 2010, um terremoto de magnitude 7 devastou o Haiti. O epicentro foi localizado na península de Tiburon, a apenas 25 quilômetros da capital Porto Príncipe. Mais de 200 mil pessoas morreram, 350 mil ficaram feridas e 1,3 milhão ficaram desabrigadas. A destruição em massa das casas da região contribuiu para a dimensão da tragédia.\n\nEm 16 de dezembro de 1920, um tremor devastou o centro-norte da China. Cerca de dez cidades foram atingidas. Embora registros da época apontassem magnitude 7,8 na escala Richter, especialistas afirmam que o terremoto de Kansu pode ter alcançado 8,5. Mais de 200 mil pessoas morreram. A região não enfrentava um abalo sísmico havia 280 anos.\n\nEm 1º de setembro de 1923, um megatremor atingiu as principais cidades do Japão. Em Tóquio e Yokohama, mais de 60 mil pessoas morreram em incêndios provocados pelo abalo. No total, foram 143 mil vítimas. O terremoto de Kwanto alterou até a geografia da região, aprofundando a baía de Sagami em mais de 250 metros em alguns pontos.\n\nEm 28 de dezembro de 1908, um terremoto devastou o sul da Itália, atingindo Sicília e Calábria. O tremor foi seguido por tsunamis de até 12 metros, que quebraram na costa e ampliaram os estragos. Cerca de 120 mil pessoas morreram.\n\nEm 27 de setembro de 1290, a província de Chihli, atual Hopei, foi atingida por um terremoto que deixou 100 mil mortos. Poucos registros históricos detalham o desastre, mas a região, que inclui Tangshan, é conhecida pela recorrência de tremores, responsáveis por mais de um milhão de vítimas ao longo dos séculos.\n\nEm novembro de 1667, um terremoto destruiu a cidade de Shemakha, situada em uma região vulnerável a abalos sísmicos. O tremor deixou 80 mil mortos. Dois anos depois, novos abalos voltaram a causar apreensão aos moradores locais.\n\nEm 1º de novembro de 1755, a capital portuguesa foi atingida por três tremores em sequência. Cerca de 85% da cidade foi destruída. Gigantescas ondas atingiram a costa e o nível da água subiu cinco metros acima do normal. Um incêndio consumiu casas, igrejas, palácios e bibliotecas. O desastre natural provocou 70 mil mortos em apenas três horas.\n\nEm 31 de maio de 1970, um terremoto fez desabar um pico de gelo na Cordilheira dos Andes. Em poucos minutos, a cidade de Yungay foi soterrada por uma massa de neve e detritos que desceu a mais de 300 km/h. O desastre deixou 66 mil mortos. As inundações elevaram os prejuízos a 530 milhões de dólares."

Se cayó la operación de Marc Guéhi, pero sí que pudo sacar adelante la de Alexander Isak, que cambió St. James Park por Anfield a cambio de 144 millones de euros. La llegada del delantero sueco dejó el fichaje más caro de la historia del equipo 'red', que además batió todos los récords en cuanto a gasto de lo visto hasta ahora en el mundo del fútbol.\n\nEl Liverpool cierra este mercado de verano con 486,68 millones de euros en gastos. Un club que no suele ser muy dado a derrochar ni a estar sí o sí en cada mercado en las primeras posiciones, la propiedad ha decidido invertir tras una temporada en la que ganó la Premier League. La necesidad de renovar plantilla, oportunidades de mercado y otras bajas inesperadas, como el triste fallecimiento de Diogo Jota, han llevado al club a apostar fuerte. Isak, Wirtz, Ekitiké, Kerkez, Frimpong... movimientos interesantes, pero que llevan la cuenta cerca de los 500 'kilos'.\n\nNingún club ha gastado más en un verano en la historia del fútbol. Hasta ahora, el récord era del Chelsea 2023-24. Los 'blues' desembolsaron 464 millones por Moisés Caicedo, Roméo Lavia, Christopher Nkunku, Cole Palmer, Axel Disasi, Nico Jackson, Lesley Ugochukwu, Robert Sánchez, Djordje Petrovic, Deivid Washington y Angelo. Liverpool y Chelsea son los dos únicos equipos que han superado los 400 en un mismo mercado.\n\nEn otra prueba del músculo inglés en el mercado, la Premier League ha vuelto a liderar clasificaciones de gastos en esta ventana de traspasos con el espejo de las grandes ligas. De hecho, más allá del propio Liverpool, otros tres equipos se han metido en el 'top 10' histórico de los equipos que más han pagado en un mismo mercado de verano. El Chelsea, en su caso, asoma tres veces como caso peculiar y particular.\n\nEn esta 2025-26, se han colado el propio Chelsea con 328,16 millones. Cierto es que muchos de sus fichajes llegaron condicionados por el Mundial de Clubes en una fecha algo temprana para lo que suele ser habitual. Pero sigue sumando, invirtiendo (o gastando) en apuestas y talento joven. Jugadores más asentados ha incorporado un Arsenal que también ha batido su marca de gasto con 293,5 millones esta vez. Gyökeres, Zubimendi o Eze han sumado mucho en la cuenta.\n\nEl Newcastle, finalmente, ha sido el cuarto club que más ha pagado en este mercado de fichajes con 288,8 millones de euros en otra clara muestra de la propiedad para seguir apostando por el proyecto."

The attacks have rattled financial markets and, together with fears over Trump's erratic trade policy, left the dollar 10 per cent lower so far this year against a basket of currencies.\n\nAnd yesterday, Lagarde intervened to warn of the dangers of the US President's intervention. 'If US monetary policy were no longer independent and instead dependent on the dictates of this or that person, then I believe the effect on the balance of the American economy could, as a result of the effects this would have around the world, be very worrying,' Lagarde told French station Radio Classique. 'It is the largest economy in the world.'\n\nLagarde also said that a ruling on Friday by a US appeals court stating that most of Trump's tariffs were illegal were adding a 'further layer of uncertainty' to the global economic outlook.\n\nIn the same interview, she warned of the 'worrying' risks facing France as its government nears collapse.\n\nPrime Minister Francois Bayrou has called a confidence vote for next week, which he is expected to lose, creating fresh chaos after predecessor Michel Barnier was toppled in December.\n\nIt will leave President Emmanuel Macron the choice of appointing a new government or calling elections. Markets have responded by selling French debt, driving bond yields higher. Lagarde added: 'All risks of government collapse in any eurozone country are worrying.'"

      "body": "Australia's pace spearhead, Mitchell Starc, has called time on his career in the shortest format, leaving a legacy of fiery spells and match-winning moments. While he's widely celebrated for his heroics in Tests and ODIs, his impact in T20s was no less significant. Starc was never the flashy, attention-grabbing figure of T20 cricket, but he was always the quiet force who could change a game in a single over. He was a master of intimidation, using his raw pace and pinpoint yorkers to unsettle even the best batsmen. Starc finished his career with an impressive tally of 79 wickets from 65 matches at an economy rate of 7.74. While his numbers are good, it was his ability to deliver a game-changing spell at the most critical moments that truly set him apart.\n\n5) 3/26 vs Sri Lanka, Colombo: 2022\n\nIn a clinical performance in Sri Lanka, Starc's three wickets for 26 runs were vital in restricting the hosts to a low total. This spell was a prime example of his disciplined line and length, showing how he could combine pace with control to consistently pick up wickets and set the stage for an Australian victory.\n\n4) 3/23 vs South Africa, Cape Town: 2020\n\nThis was a masterful display of pace and swing. Starc's three wickets for 23 runs shattered the South African top order and left them reeling. It was a spell that was as much about psychological pressure as it was about skill, proving that he could be a relentless force in any conditions and against any opposition.\n\n3) 3/20 vs Pakistan, Colombo: 2012\n\nDuring the T20 World Cup 2012, Starc showed his class against a formidable Pakistan side. His three wickets for just 20 runs kept the Pakistan batters in check and ensured they couldn't get away, although the Aussie side eventually lost the game. This spell was a testament to his tactical brilliance and his ability to bowl with great intelligence under pressure.\n\n2) 3/11 vs Pakistan, Dubai: 2012\n\nA couple of months after the shortest format World Cup, Starc produced an even more sensational spell against the same opponent in the same year. He was unplayable, delivering three wickets for a mere 11 runs. This hostile and aggressive performance with the new ball was a turning point, completely derailing Pakistan's chase and leading Australia to a comfortable win.\n\nAlso READ: Top 5 courageous moments in Indian men's cricket on National Sports Day\n\n1) 4/20 vs West Indies, Brisbane: 2022\n\nThis spell stands out as Starc's career-best T20I performance. His four wickets for just 20 runs against the hard-hitting West Indies lineup were a true sight to behold. He bowled with incredible precision, using a mix of pace and cunning variations to bamboozle the batters in Brisbane and secure a dominant victory for Australia."

However, persistent talks between the clubs led to a breakthrough, allowing Bayern to secure the attacker as its fourth new signing of the transfer window after Jonathan Tah, Luis Diaz and Tom Bischof.\n\nNicolas Jackson (C) goes for goal during Chelsea's semifinal win against Fluminense in the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup at the MetLife Stadium, New Jersey, United States, July 8, 2025.

With his dynamism, speed, and hunger, he perfectly fits our profile and will immediately strengthen our attack.\"\n\nSporting director Christoph Freund echoed the praise, highlighting Jackson's pace, eye for goal, and positive character as qualities that will help him settle quickly.\n\nJackson, who will wear the No. 11 shirt previously held by Kingsley Coman, moves to Germany with an impressive resume. Since joining Chelsea from Villarreal in 2023, he has scored 30 goals in 81 matches, including a strike in the UEFA Conference League final triumph over Real Betis. The forward had earlier registered 13 goals in 48 appearances for Spanish side Villarreal before testing himself in the Premier League.\n\nA 14-time international for Senegal, Jackson is expected to provide support and competition for Harry Kane in Bayern's frontline.\n\n\"I'm really happy to now be part of this great club,\" said Jackson. \"Bayern are one of the best clubs in the world. Everyone knows the names of the legends who have played here and the success this club represents. I have got big goals and dreams, and I will give everything to help Bayern win more titles.\"\n\nJackson could make his debut as early as September 13 when Bayern faces Hamburger SV, before possibly meeting his parent club Chelsea in the UEFA Champions League later this month."

Depardieu pourrait comparaître prochainement lors d'un retentissant procès dans la capitale.\n\nSon avocat, Me Jérémie Assous, a refusé de commenter auprès de l'AFP.\n\n\"Sept ans après, sept ans d'horreur et d'enfer...

Israel's campaign of aerial bombardment and ground offensives have reduced the vast majority of Gaza to rubble, displaced nearly the entire 2.2 million population of Gaza, and killed tens of thousands -- with civilians outnumbering terrorists as per Israel's own admission.

In July, the UN published a video that showed Israel firing at Palestinians awaiting a UN food convoy.\n\nIrrespective of the worldwide condemnation of its actions, Israel has launched a renewed offensive to take over Gaza City and has ended temporary pauses in bombardment it had announced a few weeks back under pressure from the international community.\n\nRejection the declaration, the Israeli foreign ministry in a statement called it \"disgraceful\" and \"an embarrassment to the legal profession and to any academic standard\", according to The Times of Israel.\n\nThe ministry said that the declaration was based entirely on \"Hamas's campaign of lies and the laundering of those lies by others\".\n\n\"For the first time, 'Genocide Scholars' accuse the very victim of genocide -- despite Hamas's attempted genocide against the Jewish people, murdering 1,200 people, raping women, burning families alive, and declaring its goal of killing every Jew,\" the statement further said."

Starc announced his retirement from T20Is on Tuesday, after his Australian side named a squad for their October series in New Zealand in the build-up to the T20 World Cup 2026.\n\nHe featured for Australia 65 times in this format, picking up 79 wickets. Only leg-spinner Adam Zampa has more wickets in T20Is for the Australian men's team. Over the years, Starc has produced several match-winning spells for his side in T20Is.\n\nMitchell Starc has delivered two identical spells against different Sri Lankan sides, six years apart, that rank as joint-fifth on this list. The first spell was during the 1st T20 of the Australia tour of Sri Lanka in 2016 at Pallekele. Mitchell Starc and Scott Boland bowled identical innings, taking three wickets apiece that day.\n\nThe second was again a 3/26 figure against Sri Lanka, but this time at Colombo in 2022. Australia bowled out Sri Lanka for a measly 128 runs, thanks to stellar performances from Josh Hazlewood and Starc. It was Josh Hazlewood, however, who stole the headlines, having bowled a figure of 4/16.\n\nAustralia recorded one of their largest margin of victory by runs after dismantling South Africa's batting order. Mitchell Starc took the crucial wickets of skipper Quinton de Kock and Faf du Plessis, ending their hopes of a chase. Ashton Agar also bowled an impressive spell of 3/16; however, it was Mitchell Star who was named Player of the Match.\n\nThe Australian fast bowler bowled out Mohammad Hafeez in the first ball of his spell. Despite Mitchell Starc's deathly spell of 3/20, Australia's batting lineup failed to chase down 150. This loss occurred during the 2012 T20 World Cup in Colombo. The Australians only managed to score 117 by the end of the 20 overs. Michael Hussey was the only man to perform with the bat, scoring 54 not out.\n\nDavid Warner and Shane Watson set up the victory with an Australian record opening partnership of 111. This strong start to the game helped Australia put up a total of 168/7 by the end of the 20 overs.\n\nMitchell Starc and Pat Cummins secured the win by ripping apart the Pakistan batsmen. They were all out for 74, their lowest total in the format to this date. It was an abysmal showing from Pakistan, with none of their 10 batsmen reaching the 20-run mark. Pat Cummins also registered outstanding numbers of 3 for 15 in his four overs\n\nAustralia's batting duo of David Warner and Tim David helped Australia put up an impressive 178/7 against the West Indies. Starc struck early and returned at the death to finish with career-best figures of 4 for 20. He produced a special wicket in his first over against Kyle Mayers.\n\nHe somehow managed to grab hold of a fiercely struck straight drive in front of his shin. This was his first of four wickets for the night, later claiming key wickets of Nicholas Pooran and Holder.\n\nThe left-arm fast bowler has left a great mark on cricket, especially in T20 for Australia. He has long been a staple of Australia's bowling attack and will go down as one of their finest ever bowlers. He was armed with searing pace and pinpoint yorkers, making life difficult for batters."

He made the remarks while speaking to ANI.\n\n\"What's disappointing is the relationship built over last 25 years is going down the drain in 25 hours...It is important that we stay committed, as both India and US need each other...The secondary tariffs are uncalled for,\" Aghi said.\n\nHe noted that New Delhi has responded with maturity to recent remarks made on social media by US President Donald Trump.\n\n\"India has not reacted in any negative manner on the Truth Social posts by the US President...Why is the President Trump tweeting? There are multiple stories, one is that he wants to win the Nobel Prize, the other is that the advice he is getting is incorrect...What's disappointing is the relationship built over the last 25 years is going down the drain in 25 hours...It is important that we stay committed, as both India and the US need each other...The secondary tariffs are uncalled for,\" he added.\n\nOn President Trump's claims that India has offered to reduce tariffs to zero, Aghi urged that such statements must be weighed carefully.\n\n\"...There are certain comments that the President makes, and you have to take it with certain weightage or non-weightage to it. It is important to understand that when a tweet comes out or something on Truth Social, some may have substance and some may not. I think people of India are mature and they have to do what they have to do for the good of the country,\" he said.\n\nAghi also underlined that while both countries are suffering from the trade tensions, the outlook of American businesses towards India remains overwhelmingly positive.\n\n\"Both sides are suffering due to this unreasonable secondary tariff put on India...The overall sentiment among US CEOs is very positive; they are not slowing down their investments. The confidence, trust and faith in India continues among the CEOs in the US,\" he told ANI.\n\nHis remarks came against the backdrop of Indian goods facing a steep 50 per cent tariff in the US imposed by President Donald Trump's administration. The US President has claimed that the business relationship between the two countries for many decades has been \"totally one sided\", a \"one-sided disaster\" and also said that \"they have now offered to cut their tariffs to nothing, but it's getting late\".\n\nIn a post on Monday on his social media handle Truth Social, Trump said India has charged US \"such high tariffs, the most of any country, that our businesses are unable to sell into India\".\n\n\"What few people understand is that we do very little business with India, but they do a tremendous amount of business with us. In other words, they sell us massive amounts of goods, their biggest 'client,' but we sell them very little - Until now a totally one sided relationship, and it has been for many decades. The reason is that India has charged us, until now, such high Tariffs, the most of any country, that our businesses are unable to sell into India,\" he said.\n\n\"It has been a totally one sided disaster! Also, India buys most of its oil and military products from Russia, very little from the U.S. They have now offered to cut their Tariffs to nothing, but it's getting late. They should have done so years ago. Just some simple facts for people to ponder!!!\" he added.\n\nTrump announced 25 per cent tariffs on India in July amid negotiations for a BTA between the two countries. He later announced 25 per cent secondary tariffs for India's import of Russian oil with 50 per cent tariffs coming into effect from August 27."

The longtime couple exchanged 'I dos' in a private ceremony over the holidays.\n\nMoretz and Harrison have been spotted together several times in recent years. And although they've never kept their romance a secret, they've kept their relationship private for the most part. So, who is Moretz's new wife? Here's what you need to know about Harrison.\n\nHarrison is no stranger to the fashion world, having started working as a model when she was just a young teen. In fact, Oskar Umbrellas, an Instagram fan account for Moretz (and Harrison, too), recently posted a series of photos from what is believed to be one of Harrison's first modelling gigs.\n\nThe photos feature Harrison wearing various dresses from Elizabeth Dye's Heroines Bridal Collection for a bridal fashion show event in Portland, Oregon, in January 2010. It is believed that the photos were taken around December 2009. At that time, Harrison was just 18 years old.\n\nYears later, Harrison would go on to sign with various modeling agencies around the world. While her main agency is listed as Freedom LA, Harrison is also signed with Freedom Miami, Q6 Model & Artist, Modelwerk in Germany, Elite in New York, and Vivien's Model Management in Sydney, Australia.\n\nWhile doing a lot of fashion work, Harrison has also been hard at work on The Testing Work. Freedom describes the venture as 'a creative space for up-and-coming creatives to collaborate and create imagery through unique and inspiring test shoots.'\n\nWith The Testing Network, Harrison aims to help fellow models create better portfolios. At the moment, the website for The Testing Network appears to be down, but in an excerpt from a statement that Harrison shared for the site from Elle, she wrote, 'I have found that when a shoot is curated with a full team of creatives, these shoots are some of the most inspiring, influential, and fulfilling experiences I've had of my career. But those tests are a rarity, and they shouldn't have to be.'\n\nMeanwhile, during her free time, Harrison spends a lot of time with Moretz, with the couple taking several trips around the world. Back in July, Harrison posted some photos of herself and Moretz in Paris. It is unclear if the couple had gone to Paris at that time for their wedding dress fittings at Louis Vuitton. On the caption, she wrote, 'Life is feeling full lately.'"

Bağımsız çalışan gazeteciler de sosyal medya hesaplarında eyleme destek veren mesajlar paylaştı.\n\nEyleme aralarında Katar merkezli Al Jazeera, İngiltere merkezli The Independent ile The Guardian, Hollanda merkezli De Volkskrant, Almanya merkezli Tageszeitung ile Frankfurter Rundschau, İspanyol RTVE ile InfoLibre, Fransa merkezli L'Humanite ile La Croix, Sırbistan merkezli N1, Güney Kore merkezli Media Today, Brezilya merkezli Intercept Brasil, Kosovalı KOHA, Belçika merkezli Le Libre ve Fas merkezli Le Desk gibi kuruluşların da yer aldığı çok sayıda etkin kuruluş destek verdi.\n\n\"BU AYNI ZAMANDA HABERCİLİĞE KARŞI AÇILMIŞ BİR SAVAŞ\"\n\nRSF Genel Direktörü Thibaut Bruttin, konuya ilişkin yayımladığı açıklamada, \"İsrail ordusu, Gazze'de gazetecilerin öldürülmesine bu hızda devam ederse, yakında size bilgi ulaştıracak kimse kalmayacak. Bu sadece Gazze'ye karşı değil, aynı zamanda haberciliğe karşı açılmış bir savaş. Gazeteciler hedef alınıyor, öldürülüyor ve itibarsızlaştırılıyor. Onlar olmazsa bizi kıtlık hakkında kim alarma geçirecek? Savaş suçlarını kim ortaya çıkaracak? Soykırımı bize kim gösterecek?\" ifadelerini kullandı.\n\nİsrail ordusu, 10 Ağustos gecesi Al Jazeera muhabiri Enes Şerif de dahil 6 basın mensubunu öldürmüştü. Bundan 15 gün sonra, 25 Ağustos'ta birbirini izleyen 2 saldırıda, 5 basın mensubu daha öldürülmüştü."

Après trois mois de discussions, les dirigeants parisiens et leurs homologues turinois étaient parvenus à un accord autour d'un prêt payant de 10 millions d'euros assorti d'une option d'achat obligatoire à 50 millions d'euros, soit un total de 60 millions d'euros.\n\nLisez aussi : Le PSG prête Kolo Muani et boucle une arrivée surprise !\n\nMais contre toute attente, le deal a capoté et l'attaquant de 26 ans a dû se résoudre à filer en Premier League afin d'éviter de passer six mois sans compétition, puisqu'il n'entre pas dans les plans de Luis Enrique. Présent sur les antennes de RMC, Fabrice Hawkins a évoqué un problème d'égo entre les décideurs du Paris Saint-Germain SG et leurs homologues de la Vieille Dame pour expliquer le revirement constaté dans le dénouement du dossier Kolo Muani.\n\n\" Une guerre d'égo tout simplement entre les patrons des deux clubs. Ils se sont mis d'accord et finalement un a voulu changer, l'autre n'a pas apprécié. Il y a eu une guerre d'égo qui n'a pas profité au joueur \", a expliqué le journaliste dans l'After Foot, lundi soir.\n\nLisez aussi : Mercato : Après Kolo Muani, le PSG vend un autre attaquant\n\nDe son côté, La Gazzetta dello Sport rapporte que Luis Campos, conseiller sportif parisien, aurait passé un ultime coup de fil à Damien Comolli dans la nuit du dimanche à lundi, à 3h, mais le directeur général de la Juve n'a pas donné suite, puisqu'il s'était déjà positionné pour recruter Loïs Openda du RB Leipzig pour 40 millions d'euros.\n\nRandal Kolo Muani a donc été prêté à Tottenham sans option d'achat, mais contre une enveloppe de 5 millions d'euros. Reste maintenant à voir si le natif de Bondy parviendra à convaincre les Spurs de négocier un transfert définitif à l'issue de la saison."

Це помітне зростання порівняно з 61,9%, зафіксованими до виходу iPhone 16 у 2024 році.\n\nЗдебільшого люди оновлюватимуться до iPhone 17 Pro і 17 Pro Max, на які орієнтуються 38,1% опитаних. Базовий iPhone 17 зацікавив 16,7%, а iPhone 17 Air, що вирізняється ультратонким дизайном, обрали 13,5% учасників.\n\nЛише 3,3% опитаних заявили, що вони чекають на вихід iPhone-розкладачки, яку поки що навіть не анонсували.\n\nЧас автономної роботи став головним стимулом для оновлення, на що вказали 53% фанатів, за ним послідували новий дизайн і функції (36,2%), поліпшення екрану (34,3%), поліпшення камер (28,1%), а також штучний інтелект і оптимізація програмного забезпечення (7,1%).\n\nУ той час як деякі власники iPhone вважають ціну \"червоним прапором\", для інших це не проблема. Близько 35% опитаних заявили, що все одно куплять iPhone 17, навіть якщо ціна зросте, про що свідчать чутки.\n\nЗгідно з чутками і витоками, що циркулюють у мережі, це буде найцікавіша серія за iPhone довгий час. Pro-моделі вийдуть у новому дизайні, яскравих кольорах, а також уперше отримають 12 ГБ ОЗП і всі 3 основні камери з роздільною здатністю 48 МП.\n\nОсобливий інтерес викликає iPhone 17 Air, який замінить непопулярну Plus-версію. Інсайдери писали, що 17 Air буде всього 5,5 мм завтовшки, але через такий тонкий корпус він матиме лише одну камеру і маленьку батарею.\n\nДжерела Bloomberg розповідали про 3-річний план Apple з оновлення iPhone, який почнеться якраз таки з iPhone 17. На другий рік компанія представить складаний iPhone, а у 2027 році, до 20-річчя лінійки, вийде повністю безрамковий Айфон."

À l'occasion de la 80 session de l'Assemblée générale de l'Organisation des nations unies (ONU), dont le lancement doit avoir lieu mardi 9 septembre, plusieurs pays ont annoncé vouloir reconnaître l'État de Palestine.\n\nLe dernier en date : la Belgique, dont le ministre des Affaires étrangères Maxime Prévot a indiqué sur Twitter que \" des sanctions fermes sont prises à l'égard du gouvernement israélien \".\n\nL'Assemblée générale doit être lancée au siège de l'ONU à New York le mardi 9 septembre à 15 heures, pour une fin prévue le 23 septembre. Elle sera présidée par Annalena Baerbock, ex-ministre des Affaires étrangères allemande, qui deviendra la cinquième femme seulement à occuper cette fonction. Rassemblant chacun des 193 États membres dans un espace de discussion multilatéral unique pour débattre, l'Assemblée générale de l'ONU est la principale instance d'élaboration des politiques de l'instance.\n\nLa reconnaissance de l'État palestinien sera sans aucun doute au cœur des débats. Avant le royaume belge, d'autres pays avaient pris position en ce sens. À commencer par la France : fin juillet, Emmanuel Macron annonçait sa décision de reconnaître l'État en septembre. Plusieurs pays occidentaux lui ont rapidement emboîté le pas - le Canada, l'Australie, le Portugal, la Finlande, le Luxembourg, la Nouvelle-Zélande, Andorre, Malte ou encore Saint-Marin. Le Royaume-Uni s'y est aussi engagé, si Israël ne prenait pas une série d'engagements, dont celui d'un cessez-le-feu. En 2025, les trois quarts des États membres de l'ONU ont reconnu ou comptent reconnaître l'État de Palestine.\n\nDes tensions pourraient également naître avec les États-Unis. Fin août, Washington a annoncé refuser de délivrer des visas à quelque 80 Palestiniens pour l'assemblée générale. Parmi eux, notamment : le président de l'Autorité palestinienne, Mahmoud Abbas. L'Autorité palestinienne a exprimé \" son profond regret et son étonnement \", et a appelé Washington à \" revenir \" sur cette décision, qu'elle estime \" en contradiction avec le droit international \". L'Union européenne a aussi appelé à \" reconsidérer \" cette décision. Jean-Noël Barrot, ministre de l'Europe et des Affaires étrangères, a appuyé ce propos, soulignant que l'Assemblée générale des Nations unies ne pouvait faire l'objet de \" restrictions d'accès \".\n\nLa question de la Palestine est par ailleurs bel et bien inscrite au programme de l'ordre du jour provisoire de la réunion, disponible sur le site de l'ONU. Elle sera abordée dans le cadre du volet \" Maintien de la paix et de la sécurité internationales \", au titre de la résolution 77/22. Adoptée par l'Assemblée générale en décembre 2024, celle-ci réaffirme notamment \" que les réfugiés de Palestine ont droit à la jouissance de leurs biens et du produit de ces biens, conformément aux principes d'équité et de justice \" et qu'il faut prendre \" toutes les mesures nécessaires afin de protéger les biens et les avoirs des Arabes et leurs droits de propriété en Israël \".\n\nLa question doit aussi être abordée au titre de la résolution 79/89, qui souligne entre autres que l'ONU est \" investie d'une responsabilité permanente en ce qui concerne la question de Palestine, jusqu'à ce que celle-ci soit réglée sous tous ses aspects, de manière satisfaisante et dans le respect de la légitimité internationale \".\n\nElle prie également le Comité pour l'exercice des droits inaliénables du peuple palestinien qu'il mette tout \" en œuvre pour promouvoir l'exercice effectif des droits inaliénables du peuple palestinien, y compris son droit à l'autodétermination, de contribuer à mettre sans tarder un terme à l'occupation israélienne qui dure depuis 1967, à concrétiser la solution des deux États, sur la base des frontières d'avant 1967, et à parvenir à un règlement juste de toutes les questions relatives au statut final \".\n\nLes autres sujets ne manqueront pas lors de la session à venir. \" La situation dans les territoires ukrainiens temporairement occupés \" doit également être abordée par la 80 session de l'Assemblée générale.\n\nÀ Découvrir Le Kangourou du jour Répondre Viennent ensuite quantité de thèmes parfois relégués au second plan par les conflits en cours dans le monde : rapport annuel du Conseil économique et social pour donner un état des lieux des progrès dans ces domaines, suivi des engagements pris par les États membres dans la lutte contre le VIH, focus sur les engagements pris lors de divers sommets de l'ONU, soutenabilité de la dette extérieure, stabilisation des prix des produits de base et des matières premières, mais aussi cheminement vers le développement durable, prévention des risques de catastrophes naturelles, ou encore avancées concernant le désarmement mondial et dans la lutte contre les drogues et pour la prévention...\n\nDe nombreuses autres questions, qu'elles touchent à l'économie, le social ou la politique, doivent être abordées pendant cette session. L'Assemblée générale de l'ONU dispose de quinze jours pour aborder et s'accorder sur - entre autres - l'ensemble de ces sujets."

La jefa de la Comisión Europea sostuvo que los países europeos trabajan en \"un despliegue multinacional de tropas con el respaldo de los estadounidenses\".\n\nSus declaraciones se produjeron en el contexto de una prevista reunión de líderes europeos, el secretario general de la OTAN, Mark Rutte, y el líder del régimen de Kiev, Vladímir Zelenski, que podría celebrarse el 4 de septiembre en París, donde se discutirán las garantías de seguridad para Ucrania."

At 38, Djokovic will become the oldest major singles champion in history if he lifts the trophy.\n\nThe world No 7 reached the semi-finals at the first three Grand Slams of 2025, while he reached his last major final at Wimbledon in 2024, losing to Carlos Alcaraz.\n\nIn videos posted on his Instagram account, Mouratoglou broke down his thoughts on Djokovic's chances at the US Open by giving a rating out of 10 in six categories.\n\n\"General level: eight out of 10. Enough to be above most of the players, which he does every time. But so far, in the last year, year and a half, not enough to beat Alcaraz and Sinner,\" said the Frenchman, who has coached Serena Williams and Naomi Osaka.\n\n\"Current form: eight out of 10. Every time he shows up in a Grand Slam, he plays great, but when it gets towards the end of the tournament, he looks either tired or injured and he can't win.\n\nTaylor Fritz addresses if Novak Djokovic is 'more vulnerable than before' at US Open\n\nNovak Djokovic's personal agony confirmed as he tells media 'don't remind me'\n\n\"Experience to win a Grand Slam: of course, 10 out of 10. He's the one who won the most Grand Slams in the history.\n\n\"Ability to lift his level in big matches: eight out of 10. He was the one who had 11 out of 10 before, but again, in the last two years, with the exception of the Olympics Games where his motivation was at the top, I don't think his motivation is high enough for him to lift his level enough to beat Sinner and Alcaraz when it comes to semis of Grand Slams.\n\n\"Physical and mental freshness: I give him a seven out of 10. Before the tournament, I mean anyone could think he would be a 10 out of 10; he didn't play at all since Wimbledon. Looked a little bit out of shape, not in terms of play, but in terms of how he spoke after the match.\n\n\"And the fact that he doesn't play any tournament besides Grand Slams and it looks like it's a choice now, makes it difficult to be fully able to go through a whole Grand Slam in five sets without feeling tired.\"\n\n\"Chances [to win] here: eight out of 10. My prediction: semi-finals.\"\n\nDjokovic will face fourth seed Taylor Fritz in the US Open quarter-final and could meet world No 2 Alcaraz if he progresses to the last four."

Netflix is dropping all four final episodes at once on September 3, 2025. That's right, no waiting between episodes, just pure, glorious binge-fodder. If you're in India, set an alarm for 12:30 PM IST, unless you're cool with spoilers flooding your feed before lunch.\n\nLet's jog your memory. Wednesday waltzed back into Nevermore Academy, and honestly, things got weird fast. Her spooky psychic powers started glitching out, mysteries started piling up, and poor Enid? Major cliffhanger energy, her fate totally up in the air. Oh, and Tyler Galpin straight-up shoves Wednesday off a building. Not exactly a friendly gesture. She wakes up in the hospital, dazed and pretty much screwed.\n\nAlright, so here's the scoop on Part 2. Wednesday's not flying solo, she's got Larissa Weems (the former principal, now in full ghost mode) tagging along, trying to help her unravel whatever mess she's in and, hopefully, save Enid. Also, Lady Gaga, shows up as Rosaline Rotwood, a Nevermore faculty member with secret v8bes and maybe snake pets. Gaga drops a new song just for the show, called \"The Dead Dance.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Wednesday is still on her \"get my powers back\" grind, stumbling through sketchy alliances and digging up Addams family skeletons maybe literally, who knows.\n\nWednesday Season 2 Part 2: Release Date, Cast, Schedule, and more\n\nThere's four episodes left:\n\nSo, apparently, the showrunners (Gough and Millar) thought splitting the season would build suspense and give us a neat little arc. Did it work? The numbers say viewership crashed by half in week three. Guess some people really need their one-sitting dopamine hit. Still, Netflix is doubling down Season 3 is a go, and they're promising even more Addams weirdness and Nevermore chaos.\n\nLook, if you like dark humor, supernatural drama, or just want to see Lady Gaga act spooky and sing, this is your jam. Tim Burton's gonna Tim Burton, the story's packed with creepy twists, and Wednesday's dry wit is as sharp as ever. Whether you're here for the gothic vibes or just want to see who survives, there's plenty of bite left in this show. Get the popcorn."

      "body": "The gavel has fallen twice -- once in Canada and once in Finland -- reminding us that justice, even if uneven, still speaks across borders.\n\nIn Canada, the Immigration Appeal Division, ruling on the case of Douglas Egharevba, held that membership of the People's Democratic Party (PDP) was enough to make him inadmissible into the country. The reason? Reasonable grounds existed to believe that the party, by systemic violence and subversion of democratic institutions, had crossed the line of civility. While no formal proscription of PDP -- or its rival All Progressives Congress (APC) -- was pronounced under Canadian law, the implication was stark: association with Nigeria's dominant parties carried the stain of complicity in violence. For a court to so hold, without proof of personal wrongdoing, is a loud global indictment.\n\nAcross Europe, in Finland, the hammer struck even harder. The Päijät-Häme District Court convicted Simon Ekpa, the self-proclaimed Prime Minister of the so-called Biafra Government-in-Exile, of terrorism-related offences. His crimes included incitement to terrorism, participation in a terrorist organisation, and facilitation of arms and explosives. The judgment was not symbolic -- it carried a six-year prison sentence. No ambiguity. No immigration technicalities. Ekpa, guilty as charged.\n\nPlaced side by side, these two pronouncements point us to one undeniable truth: while the right of any nation or people, including the Igbo, to seek self-determination is legitimate under international law, the world frowns heavily at violent options. Violence is the fast track to global isolation. IPOB, long caught between agitation and armed provocation, now stands at a crossroads. Reinvent themselves in line with non-violence, or forfeit the global sympathy needed to advance the cause of Biafra.\n\nBut the other side of this coin cannot be ignored. What is good for the goose is good for the gander. If the Nigerian state applauds the Finnish court for sentencing Simon Ekpa, then it cannot dismiss the Canadian court's ruling on the violent character of its two dominant parties, APC and PDP. One cannot cherry-pick justice abroad. To do so is hypocrisy of the highest order.\n\nThis brings us home to the institutional failure of INEC, the body saddled with the regulation of political parties. If foreign courts are raising questions about the violent DNA of our parties, what has INEC done to sanitize the space? The answer is simple -- nothing. Violence, thuggery, ballot snatching, vote-buying -- these have become the enduring currencies of our elections, tolerated and normalized by a commission that should be an umpire but acts as an enabler.\n\nThe judgments in Canada and Finland should be a mirror for us. They expose the shame we bury under propaganda. They call us out on the violence that has become the language of politics and agitation in Nigeria. They remind us that while democracy allows the pursuit of power and even self-determination, the path of violence discredits both the parties in government and the movements seeking freedom.\n\nAPC, PDP, Simon Ekpa: guilty as charged. Different courts, different contexts, same verdict. Nigeria must now decide -- shall we continue to export political violence as our most reliable product, or shall we embrace the hard but honourable work of building a nation where justice, fairness, and non-violence underpin our politics?\n\nThe world is watching and history beckons!\n\nDr. Bolaji O.

The token rose 135% after its ICO, buoyed by public staking from Justin Sun and brisk spot and derivatives turnover.\n\nHowever, SlowMist founder Yu Xian warned that WLFI holders are being targeted by phishing schemes tied to Ethereum's EIP-7702 upgrade, which lets externally owned wallets temporarily act like smart-contract wallets.\n\nAccording to Xian, attackers first obtain private keys through phishing, then pre-install a malicious \"delegate\" contract on the victim's address. When funds arrive, the contract can trigger and drain balances.\n\nA user report on 31 August described WLFI being stolen shortly after an ETH top-up, consistent with this method. Another early supporter recounted a 2024 wallet compromise, recovering only about 20% of vested WLFI while 80% remains exposed in the compromised account.\n\nMeanwhile, analytics firm Bubblemaps flagged \"bundled clones,\" look-alike contracts that mimic legitimate projects and lure users into irreversible transfers. In response, the WLFI team stated it does not provide support via direct messages and directed users to official email channels to avoid impostors. The message is plain: treat unsolicited outreach as hostile terrain.\n\nDespite these setbacks, trading stayed elevated. Derivatives volume surpassed $12 billion, and open interest increased across major venues, indicating ongoing speculation. Additionally, WLFI announced a partnership with Alt5 Sigma, which recently outlined a $1.5 billion crypto treasury program. The linkage gives WLFI added distribution and corporate attention, even as security warnings climb.\n\nFor now, WLFI's launch looks like a stress test for retail security in on-chain markets. Phishing tied to EIP-7702 exploits user key exposure, not a WLFI contract flaw. Therefore, the immediate performance will hinge on basic safeguards -- clean keys, verified contracts, and official channels -- while liquidity and partnerships keep the order books busy."

(Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg)\n\nPresident Donald Trump said India offered to cut tariffs, while New Delhi signaled it's continuing to negotiate a trade agreement with the U.S., indicating both sides are keeping the door open to resolving tensions.\n\nTrump said in a social media post Sept. 1 that India offered to reduce its tariffs on U.S. goods to zero, without saying when the concession was made. He added that \"it's getting late\" and India should have made the offer \"years ago.\"\n\nIndia's government hasn't officially responded to Trump's remarks, but Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal said at an event on Sept. 2 that both sides continue to engage to reach a trade agreement.\n\n\"We are in dialog with the U.S. for a bilateral trade agreement,\" Goyal said in New Delhi.\n\nThere are no formal talks taking place between the trade negotiators at the moment after a U.S. team canceled its trip to India in August. Bloomberg News reported last week that the two nations are keeping informal communication channels open.\n\nTrump's latest post may signal that the U.S. remains open to trade talks, according to Abhijit Das, a former Indian trade official and author on trade matters. \"This is his attempt to walk back on his earlier hardened stance on India,\" he said.\n\nTrump slapped India with 50% tariffs on exports to the U.S. to penalize it for its trade barriers and its purchases of Russian oil. India was among the first countries to open trade talks with the Trump administration, with the U.S. president and Prime Minister Narendra Modi committing to a bilateral deal by the fall of this year.\n\nThe two sides failed to clinch a deal after five rounds of talks, with the U.S. getting increasingly frustrated with New Delhi's unwillingness to budge on key issues, such as opening up its dairy and agriculture markets. Trump later began threatening India with additional tariffs because of its purchases of Russian oil, which he says is helping to fund Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.\n\nIndia had made several concessions early on in the negotiations, including offering to reduce tariffs on industrial goods, such as auto components and pharmaceuticals, to zero if the U.S. reciprocated."

      "body": "President John Dramani Mahama has officially removed Chief Justice Gertrude Araba Esaaba Sackey Torkornoo from office, acting on the recommendations of a constitutional committee that found her guilty of stated misbehaviour.\n\nChief Justice Gertrude Torkornoo sacked\n\nThe announcement, made on September 1 by Government Communications Minister Felix Kwakye Ofosu, has sparked widespread debates across Ghana and beyond.\n\nThe committee's findings cited several infractions, including the misuse of public funds for personal travel and questionable administrative decisions that breached constitutional provisions.\n\nFollowing this development, numerous reactions have emerged from both major political parties, as well as influential voices within the Ghanaian society.\n\nThis script will list the number of notable persons who have reacted to the news so far.\n\nKwaku Ansa-Asare\n\nKwaku Ansa-Asare, a former Director of the Ghana School of Law, has justified the removal of the Chief Justice.\n\nAccording to him, the move demonstrates the robustness of Ghana's democratic and constitutional systems.\n\nSpeaking on The Pulse on JoyNews, Ansa-Asare maintained that rather than expressing dismay, Ghanaians should take pride in the fact that constitutional processes are being upheld.\n\n\"If you allege that your constitutional rights are being violated, and you yourself as the head of the judiciary do not understand the ramifications of the Chief Justice removal process, you shoot yourself wrongly in the foot,\" Ansa-Asare asserted.\n\nHe continued, \"I don't think that we should be sad about this; we should rather be happy. We should be happy that the constitution is working. This is a democracy.\"\n\nHowever, Ansa-Asare stressed that any presidential action must be judged solely by its adherence to the constitution.\n\n\"If the president has to act, every step the president takes, he must act in accordance with the constitution.\n\n\"So far, I have yet to be convinced that the president has contravened the constitutional process. No one has been able to pinpoint exactly where President Mahama has gotten it wrong,\" he added.\n\nThe 'sins' of sacked Chief Justice Torkornoo\n\nNana Agyei Baffour Awuah\n\nThe Member of Parliament for Manhyia South, Nana Agyei Baffour Awuah, has also weighed in on the matter, accusing and criticising the judiciary for failing to protect the Chief Justice during the process that led to her removal from office.\n\nHe expressed disappointment that all the applications she filed at the Human Rights Court were dismissed under what he described as \"bizarre circumstances,\" with the justification that the court lacked jurisdiction.\n\nBaffour Awuah argued that the situation amounted to a sacrilegious attempt to oust the Chief Justice, stressing that the move was pre-determined and deliberately executed.\n\nSpeaking on Ekosii Sen on Asempa 94.7 FM on Monday, September 1, 2025, the MP alleged that the plan to remove Justice Torkornoo was not a recent development, but a long-standing agenda conceived by the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC) and its flagbearer, former President John Dramani Mahama.\n\n\"The courts should have stood by her and defended her rights. Instead, what we witnessed was an orchestrated scheme to disgrace and remove her from office,\" the Manhyia South legislator stated.\n\nDr Joshua Jebuntie Zaato\n\nA political scientist at the University of Ghana, Dr Joshua Jebuntie Zaato, has also described the removal of Chief Justice Gertrude Torkonoo as a politically-significant milestone in Ghana's Fourth Republic.\n\nSpeaking in an interview on TV3 on September 1, 2025, Dr Zaato asserted that history would remember President John Dramani Mahama as the first Ghanaian leader to dismiss a sitting Chief Justice, an unprecedented event under the 1992 Constitution.\n\n\"History will not remember constitutionality, no. History will remember that under the constitution, in this Fourth Republic, it was His Excellency John Dramani Mahama who was the first to fire a sitting Chief Justice, a member of the coequal arms of government.\n\n\"Tomorrow, when constitutional law is being taught, this example will always come up. So far, it is probably the biggest achievement of this government, the removal of the Chief Justice,\" he added.\n\nMartin Kpebu explains why sacked Chief Justice cannot go back to the SC\n\nGabby Otchere-Darko\n\nA leading figure of the New Patriotic Party (NPP), Gabby Asare Otchere-Darko, has also reacted to the removal of Chief Justice Gertrude Araba Esaaba Sackey Torkornoo by President John Dramani Mahama.\n\nIn a video shared on X, Otchere-Darko expressed his support for the Chief Justice, stating that he stands firmly with her.\n\nHe wrote, \"Well put Dr Zaato. I stand with CJ Torkonoo and with Ghana.\"\n\nNii Ayikoi Otoo\n\nFormer Attorney General and lead counsel for former Chief Justice Gertrude Sackey Torkornoo, Nii Ayikoi Otoo, has as well stated that the five-member Pwamang Committee, which investigated the petitions ignored the judiciary's travel policy presented to them.\n\nSpeaking on JoyNews on September 1, 2025, Ayikoi Otoo disclosed that his team submitted a judiciary travel policy during the committee's investigations, but the committee did not refer to it.\n\n\"... There is a travel policy for the judiciary but they never referred to it. Although we tendered in the document that this is the travel policy, they didn't refer to it,\" he said.\n\nThe learned legal practitioner further argued that Justice Torkornoo committed no wrongdoing, stressing that she is entitled to travel with one person of her choice, as outlined in the judiciary's travel policy.\n\n\"She's entitled to travel with one person of her choice and she chose to do it. Remember that there have been other Chief Justices, some of them who had no spouses, and therefore, the law, as at the time, was that you could go with any person of your own choice, other than your spouse. So, what wrong did the former Chief Justice commit?\" he quizzed.\n\nSacking CJ is the biggest achievement of Mahama's government - UG lecturer\n\nKofi Tonto\n\nKofi Tonto, an aide to former Vice President Dr Mahamudu Bawumia, has also criticised the president, describing the process as \"an evil seed\" sown by him.\n\nIn a post on X, the politician urged the president to tread cautiously, warning that his actions could one day come back to haunt him.\n\n\"The evil seed Mahama has planted shall remain in the soil for many years to come. Mark it!\" he wrote.\n\nOther notable figures, including the Minority Leader in Parliament, Alexander Kwamina Afenyo-Markin; Ama Governor; Richard Ahiagbah; and Miracles Aboagye of the New Patriotic Party, have reacted to the Chief Justice's removal.\n\nVKB/AE\n\nGhanaWeb's latest documentary, Sex for Fish, that explores the plights of teenage girls in coastal communities, all in an attempt to survive, is out.

      "body": "Each of the four seasons can be characterized by a specific vibe when it comes to the music we have on repeat. Regardless of genre, seasonal playlists are entirely surmised of the feelings evoked by their respective seasons. Summer, for example, is characterized by the upbeat, jovial sounds of youth, where winter may signalize more of a melancholy feeling.\n\nThe transitional period between two seasons is also a gold mine for playlist curation, as one can draw from their two combined feelings. With fall on the horizon, and it will be here before we know it, Labor Day weekend is all about soaking up those last few drops of summer -- and, of course, the ever-popular three-day weekend.\n\nNo matter how you're spending your Labor Day -- on a boat on a lake in the Midwest, at a festival on the coast, or at a blowout BBQ down south -- music will undoubtedly be a crucial part of making it as relaxing and enjoyable as possible, and any Labor Day playlist would be incomplete without some combination of these three vibes.\n\nRetro Labor Day Classics\n\nEver since the '80s, there have been a handful of Americana and Heartland Rock legends who have become, and will continue to be, staples on Labor Day for years to come. Heartland Rock rose in popularity, at least in part, due to the way it resonates with working-class Americans, the very people for whom Labor Day exists.\n\nFirst, and arguably foremost, is \"Pink Houses\" by John Mellencamp. The quintessential Labor Day song sees Mellencamp asking \"Ain't that America\" in a way that is both critical of how labor is sometimes treated in the US, but still celebrates our country just the same. In addition to the lyrics, this song boasts a sound that is the perfect balance between summer and fall vibes.\n\nOf course, one can't discuss Heartland Rock on Labor Day without mentioning The Boss. Nearly every song on Bruce Springsteen's Born In The U.S.A. would be a great addition to your Labor Day playlist, but the one that really sticks out is \"Glory Days.\" It's the perfect juxtaposition between enjoying Labor Day now, and reminiscing on the Labor Days of your youth, too.\n\nIronically, one of the most notable lines of \"Mary Jane's Last Dance\" is \"I feel summer creepin' in / and I'm tired of this town again,\" but the sound still prompts the feelings of the end of summertime, too. I'd be remiss if I didn't shout out another Petty track, \"American Girl,\" but similar to Springsteen, you really can't go wrong with Petty on Labor Day.\n\nLive Staples And Festival Highlights\n\nIf there's one thing Labor Day Weekend never lacks, it's amazing live music experiences. Dozens of festivals take place across the nation, along with a number of equally massive individual concert experiences to fill in the gaps.\n\nOne of the biggest festivals on the docket this weekend was EDM's North Coast, celebrating their 15th anniversary this year nonetheless. Closing out night one of North Coast was none other than Chris Lake, whose \"Toxic\" samples \"Poison\" by Bill Bev DeVoe, and happens to be a smooth yet upbeat dance hit, perfect for your Labor Day playlist.\n\nThis Labor Day Weekend also saw some massive concerts, including Oasis, whose Live '25 world tour features a two-night event at MetLife Stadium with support from Cage The Elephant and Cast. One hit that will surely grace the stage at MetLife this Labor Day is \"Live Forever,\" a pleasant, laid-back earworm that oozes end-of-summer nostalgia.\n\nPerhaps the biggest festival of the weekend, however, is none other than the Jazz Aspen Snowmass (JAS) Labor Day Experience. Don't be fooled, though -- the JAS Labor Day Experience is far from a jazz festival, as evidenced by this year's modern rock headliner, Imagine Dragons, whose \"Bones\" should fit nicely between Chris Lake's EDM and Bruce Springsteen's '80s sentimentality.\n\nModern-Day Anthems\n\nAs much as Heartland Rock and electric live performances tend to dominate Labor Day, it's the new-age folk rock anthems that tie everything together. No Labor Day playlist would be complete without the modern rockers who took Tom Petty's influence, and are using that inspiration to light up the stages at the festivals of today.\n\nBig Thief is the 21st century folk Americana band for 20th century fans of Creedence Clearwater Revival or Joni Mitchell. Their southern country and modern folk influences check all the boxes of nearly every major decade of contemporary music. Their track \"Red Moon\" is an upbeat, yet soft and easy track, perfect for any summer to fall transitional playlist.\n\nThe War On Drugs is dad rock if dad rock was a genre that was still in its defining phase. Lead vocalist Adam Granduciel has an inherently soothing voice, and on the band's fifth album, I Don't Live Here Anymore, they partnered with fellow modern rockers Lucius for the title track, creating an equal parts soothing and exciting end-of-August anthem.\n\nAmericana has certainly evolved in the last decade or so, with artists like Ethel Cain leading the charge. Though her sound does tend towards gothic dreampop, the third yet arguably most popular single from her breakout album, Preacher's Daughter, \"American Teenager,\" is a nostalgic, upbeat, Heartland Rock-influenced reckoning with what it's like to be, well, an American teenager."

      "body": "Eric San Juan.- Sesenta y cinco años después de establecer relaciones diplomáticas, Cuba y Vietnam exhiben una amistad que ha resistido los vaivenes políticos mundiales, como lo demuestra la reciente recaudación en Hanói de más de 15 millones de dólares en pocos días para enviar ayuda a la isla.\n\nLa cercanía entre ambos países se plasmó este martes en la capital vietnamita, donde el presidente cubano, Miguel Díaz-Canel, participó como invitado en la fastuosa celebración del 80 aniversario de la declaración de independencia del país asiático.\n\nLas relaciones entre ambas naciones se fraguaron a partir de 1960, quince años después de que Ho Chi Minh proclamara en Hanói la independencia de Vietnam y cuando el país asiático se iba hundiendo en un sangriento conflicto bélico.\n\nCuba se convirtió entonces en el primer país americano en reconocer a la República Democrática de Vietnam, a la que prestó ayuda durante la guerra en forma de alimentos, medicamentos, doctores, asistencia militar y en la construcción de infraestructuras.\n\nDesde entonces y pese a la distancia geográfica, ambos países han cultivado una relación muy cercana, cimentada en la afinidad ideológica y alimentada con intercambios económicos y culturales y una retórica de hermandad.\n\nEl espíritu de cercanía quedó patente en agosto con una campaña nacional de recaudación en Vietnam para enviar ayuda a Cuba. La meta inicial de 2,5 millones de dólares se alcanzó en apenas 30 horas y la cifra final superó los 15,2 millones, aportados por ministerios, sindicatos, empresas y ciudadanos.\n\nLos vínculos tienen un carácter especial para los vietnamitas que vivieron la convulsa época de la guerra y los años de la posguerra, en que Cuba era uno de los pocos aliados con que contaba su país.\n\nDesde entonces, miles de jóvenes vietnamitas han cursado parte de sus estudios en Cuba: muchos iban allí sin saber una palabra de español y regresaban hablando el idioma con un marcado acento cubano.\n\nUno de los puntos álgidos de esta relación se produjo en septiembre de 1973, cuando Fidel Castro visitó la provincia de Quang Tri, devastada por los bombardeos estadounidenses, y pronunció su célebre frase: \"¡Por Vietnam, Cuba está dispuesta a dar hasta su propia sangre!\".\n\nAquel gesto se evocó de nuevo en 2016, cuando el país asiático despidió con honores al líder cubano tras su fallecimiento, con miles de personas rindiéndole homenaje en la embajada cubana en Hanói.\n\nLa cooperación actual se refleja en proyectos agrícolas, sanitarios y de infraestructuras, así como en el apoyo político mutuo en foros internacionales, que ha prevalecido más allá de los cambios internos en cada nación.\n\nAsí, durante la pandemia de covid-19, Cuba mostró su solidaridad al enviar a Vietnam más de un millón de dosis de su vacuna Abdala.\n\nLa visita de Díaz-Canel a Hanói y la participación en el 80 aniversario de la independencia vietnamita refuerzan la idea de continuidad de una amistad que ha superado los vaivenes de la Historia, como la caída de la Unión Soviética, que en los años 90 del siglo pasado obligó a Vietnam a acelerar su apertura para buscar nuevas alianzas.\n\nDesde entonces, el país asiático ha vivido uno de los mayores desarrollos económicos de la Historia, mientras Cuba atravesaba épocas de gran penuria y era quien necesitaba la ayuda de su histórico aliado."

      "body": "CHAPEL HILL, N.C. -- North Carolina's pregame Old Well Walk was received with substantial excitement, as fans couldn't help but express their astonishment when Bill Belichick walked off the team bus with his navy blue, Jordan Brand UNC jacket and sweatsuit with some Carolina Blue kicks to match.\n\n\"I just looked at Bill Belichick!\" One student eagerly exclaimed. \"He's real!\"\n\nThe significance wasn't lost on the crowd gathered around the Old Well, but how could it be? ESPN's College GameDay brought out its heavy hitters for UNC's Monday night game against TCU -- the only college football game that took place on Labor Day night. Months of anticipation since Belichick's hire in December brought another level of national attention and financial investment into North Carolina's football program.\n\nThe pregame scene in Chapel Hill made it clear that this wasn't just another exhibition, but rather an extravaganza. Tents for face painting and balloon twisting were set up outside of The Pit, with inflatable stations for kids posted up in front of Davis Library. UNC's Polk Place area was flooded with Tar Heel Blue as fans waited for Chase Rice to take the stage for North Carolina's highly promoted concert series. The buzz on Franklin Street about having the longtime, Super Bowl-winning New England Patriots coach on the sidelines was palpable.\n\nEnthusiasm mounted once fans started to fill up Kenan Stadium, too. When Belichick emerged from the tunnel in his grey cutoff hoodie, the student section immediately went crazy. North Carolina's very own Petey Pablo introduced the team pregame as they ran out of the tunnel with the iconic \"Raise Up\" track playing for them. The likes of UNC legends Michael Jordan, Lawrence Taylor and Roy Williams were in the building, seated together while cheering on Belichick for his first game.\n\nMonday night's spectacle met the moment in every way -- every way except for the on-field product. The Tar Heels looked several steps behind their opponent in a 48-14 home loss to TCU, tarnishing a game that was Belichick's first test in his first year in college.\n\n\"Yeah, it was a great environment tonight,\" Belichick said late Monday night after the game. \"Fans are awesome. It's great energy in the stadium. We just didn't do enough to keep it going. We've got to play better for the energy to be sustainable.\"\n\nThe build-up to the game couldn't have been better. UNC did its part with the in-house videos, behind-the-scenes content on social media and a revamped game day experience.\n\nThe team initially built off the hype to start the game, as Gio Lopez helped lead UNC down the field with a couple of big throws to Jordan Shipp to set up Caleb Hood for an eight-yard touchdown run. The defense followed that up by getting TCU's offense off the field in four plays and forcing a punt.\n\nAfter that, though, the offense completely stalled out. The unit logged just 31 yards of offense in its next seven drives, and it finished the game with three turnovers. UNC's defense had nothing for the Horned Frogs on the other end, as the Tar Heels gave up 284 yards in the passing game and 258 yards in the run game. TCU recorded 7.4 yards per carry on the ground.\n\n\"I mean, we just can't perform well doing some of the things that we did,\" Belichick said. \"We've got to be better than that, and obviously we've got to deal with Charlotte (on Saturday) and the problems they present. But we had too many self-inflicted wounds that we have to eliminate before we can worry about addressing our opponents.\"\n\nMonday night's main event was a letdown. North Carolina struggled to keep up with the visiting Horned Frogs, and the game got away from UNC by the third quarter. In Belichick's debut, his squad posed no threat and offered little resistance.\n\nThe Belichick era is still in the early stages, as rough a debut as Monday was. The luster took a hit, though, with a disappointing opening performance in Chapel Hill. A once-packed Kenan Stadium crowd started bleeding out in the third quarter, and it was practically empty before the clock showed its final zero.\n\nBelichick placed an emphasis on UNC to be football's \"33rd NFL team\" throughout the offseason, a mantra that held consistent from his arrival to his debut. But in Monday's opener, it was clear that TCU was out of North Carolina's league."

      "body": "ECB President Christine Lagarde has warned the U.S. Federal Reserve not to lose its independence to politics. A transparent maneuver, considering the ECB has long since merged with Brussels into a political entity.\n\nIn an interview with French radio station Classique, Lagarde cautioned that U.S. President Donald Trump is attempting to seize control over the Federal Reserve. She said:\n\n\"If US monetary policy were no longer independent and instead dependent on the dictates of this or that person, then I believe that the effect on the balance of the American economy could, as a result of the effects this would have around the world, be very worrying.\"\n\nIndeed, Trump (this or that person) is exerting massive pressure on the Fed. His attempt to exploit the internal scandal surrounding Fed Governor Lisa Cook to remove her via executive order and replace her with an ally is undisputed.\n\nCook is accused of providing false information in mortgage dealings, allegedly declaring an Atlanta condominium as her primary residence while previously claiming her Michigan home, raising the specter of mortgage fraud.\n\nGood Cop, Bad Cop\n\nRegardless of the outcome, this marks the latest peak in the battle between Trump and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, whom Trump accuses of interest rate sabotage. Powell countered the massive inflation surge caused by liquidity injections during the COVID lockdowns with rapid rate hikes and has since kept U.S. rates well above other central banks. Trump, in contrast, calls for drastic rate cuts to free the frozen housing market and ease state interest burdens.\n\nIt remains unclear to what extent this public dispute between Trump and Powell follows a political script. Following a \"good cop, bad cop\" dynamic, both have successfully attracted investment into the U.S. through trade policy and high rates while simultaneously devaluing the dollar against other fiat currencies. Mission accomplished, for now: the deeply negative trade balance is slowly reversing, tariff revenues are rising, and U.S. industry is regaining ground.\n\nReturn to Private Money\n\nAway from the Fed dispute, a small monetary revolution is unfolding in the U.S.: the partial return to a private banking money system. With the GENIUS Act and the rise of U.S. dollar stablecoins, the Trump administration has established the legal framework for private money creation.\n\nPrivate banks will be able to issue their own stablecoins, each backed by collateral such as U.S. Treasury bonds, gold, or Bitcoin. The U.S. is moving toward a more stable, competitive monetary system that reduces leverage risk and strengthens the banking sector compared to its European counterpart.\n\nLagarde is not entirely wrong that Fed power may be constrained going forward. But unlike the state-centered Eurozone system, the U.S. banking sector stands to gain significant influence at the Fed's expense.\n\nLagarde Has Humor\n\nIt is almost tragicomic that the ECB president warns of a loss of Fed autonomy. Since the sovereign debt crisis a decade and a half ago, the ECB has been fully merged with Brussels. Autonomy in Eurozone monetary policy is nonexistent.\n\nDuring the debt crisis, the ECB intervened massively. Nominal interest rates dropped from over 4% in 2008 to as low as -0.5%, remaining in negative territory for years. Bond purchases and long-term refinancing operations ballooned to around €3 trillion - liquidity that partially displaced private credit. This is one reason the Eurozone economy has relied on credit-financed government demand to stay afloat.\n\nWith its anti-fragmentation tools, the ECB secured peripheral bonds regardless of fiscal discipline.\n\nCrisis Never Resolved\n\nThe results of this market manipulation are evident: the Euro Club continually expanded national deficits. The disciplining effect of interest rate penalties vanished - the ECB became a state money-printing machine, political control supplanting market discipline.\n\nThe rescue operation peaked with Mario Draghi's legendary \"Whatever it takes,\" signaling that the ECB would guarantee the solvency of heavily indebted member states.\n\nSince then, the ECB has functioned as a backstop, a lender of last resort for all Eurozone countries, many of which have abandoned fiscal responsibility. Draghi's decision stripped the bond market of its teeth, undermining its role as a control mechanism.\n\nNonsense \"Made by ECB\"\n\nBrussels turned the ECB into a money pump for its ideological campaign against free markets and national sovereignty. From financing absurd climate projects to building a European war economy, the ECB monetizes growing debt, with the EU Commission contributing: the upcoming Brussels budget totals roughly €2 trillion, much to be financed through eurobond issuance, relying on the ECB to step in if the market hesitates.\n\nThe ECB is far from independent. Few central banks have subordinated themselves to politics as completely. The legacy of the conservative, stability-focused German Bundesbank is gone.\n\nSmoke Screens and Media Spin\n\nEuropean monetary politicization has enabled Brussels' socialist ecologism to entrench itself despite economic fallout. Manipulated interest rates and state guarantees have produced the largest zombie economy in the world, excepting China's real estate sector. Scarce resources are diverted to unproductive projects, freezing the Eurozone in stagnation.\n\nLagarde's Fed warnings are mere distractions. Europe faces rising sovereign debt pressures, with France on the brink of crisis. ECB tools must be ready, as no one knows when the market will issue the red card.\n\nWhile the U.S. continues monetary reform, deregulates the economy, and lowers taxes, Europe remains in regulatory paralysis. The ECB perpetuates the socialist debt spiral with ever-new liquidity injections. We are witnessing a slow-motion crash as European policymakers fail to escape their self-imposed ideological trap.\n\n* * *"

      "body": "Even though the theory is interesting, we do not have an official confirmation as of now.\n\nWhen Lady Gaga was announced as part of Wednesday Season 2, the internet erupted with excitement. The official word was that she would be playing Rosaline Rotwood, a legendary Nevermore teacher. Yet, as always with Wednesday, nothing is ever that simple. Theories started flying almost instantly. Could Lady Gaga actually be playing the role of Aunty Ophelia, Morticia Addams's eccentric sister from classic Addams lore in Wednesday? Let's talk a bit about this theory and see why it has so much traction among fans.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the deeper Addams Family mythology, Ophelia Frump, or Aunt Ophelia, is Morticia's sister. Unlike Morticia's dark and mysterious persona, Ophelia has always been written as a quirky character, quite the opposite of her sister. She's often portrayed as blonde and light-hearted, which makes her stand out in a family that thrives on gloom and doom.\n\nBringing her into Netflix's modern retelling of the Addams world would not only be bold but also give the story a chance to explore the family's history in a new way. Think about it: a character who has always been painted as comic relief suddenly walking into Wednesday's bleak and twisted narrative. It almost feels like the kind of twist that would both surprise fans and honor the original lore. And if there's one actress who could pull off that blend of comic relief and intensity, it's Lady Gaga.\n\nThe first official photo of Gaga in character stirred the biggest debate. She appears draped in white, with striking platinum-blonde hair, standing with an aura that feels half mystical and half ominous. But what really caught everyone's attention was Thing, the beloved disembodied hand, resting casually on her shoulder.\n\nThing have always been more than just comic relief. He's loyal, fiercely protective, and deeply tied to the Addams family. So, seeing him perched comfortably next to Lady Gaga sparked instant theories that she's not just a teacher at Nevermore but someone connected to Wednesday's family itself. After all, Thing wouldn't simply cozy up to a stranger without a reason.\n\nAdding fuel to the fire, Jenna Ortega, who plays Wednesday, made a cryptic statement during an interview with Entertainment Tonight. She said,\n\n\"She's not a teacher. Whatever you heard is wrong.\"\n\nThat single line sent fans into a frenzy. If Gaga is not actually Rosaline Rotwood, the way Netflix's promotional material suggests, then who is she? The most popular conclusion was simple: she must be Ophelia in disguise.\n\nOther than that, the show itself has already planted breadcrumbs for Ophelia's appearance. In Part 1, viewers were introduced to talks of a missing sister, and the Willow Hill asylum storyline hinted at dark family secrets.\n\n[Spoiler!] Is Rosaline Rotwood (the character now revealed to be played by Lady Gaga) another Raven in Wednesday's bloodline?\n\nbyu/sparkkeeper inWEDNESDAYsingle\n\nThere was a scene as well showing an abandoned cemetery with a tombstone and Rosaline Rotwood etched on it. Moreover, a raven was sitting on Rosaline's erected tombstone, and we already know that Ophelia was an Avian.\n\nIn addition to this, in the trailer for Wednesday Season 2 Part 2, we see Wednesday, Morticia, and Morticia's mother sitting and performing, what can be assumed to be, a seance. Now, it is likely that they are trying to talk to Ophelia, who will appear as a ghost, which highly resembles the first look at Lady Gaga's character Rosaline Rotwood.\n\nThemes of suppressed histories and haunting legacies were brought up now and then, suggesting that an Addams family member long kept out of sight might soon re-enter the story. Dropping Ophelia into the story at this stage would be a perfect payoff for all the subtle hints we've been given so far.\n\nEven though the theory sounds very convincing, not all fans are convinced. Some believe that Frances O'Connor, another new addition to the cast, could actually be playing Ophelia, while Lady Gaga's Rosaline is a brand-new character designed to add to Wednesday's lore. There's also the chance that Netflix is deliberately feeding the fandom just enough misleading information to keep the theories alive until the reveal. After all, this kind of speculation keeps Wednesday trending, and that benefits everyone involved.\n\nSo, is Lady Gaga really playing Aunty Ophelia in Wednesday? The clues are there. The look, the Thing connection, Jenna Ortega's sly comment, and the narrative groundwork all point in that direction. However, nothing is confirmed. So, I believe that we will have to wait just a little longer to find out what we have at hand with the second instalment of Wednesday Season 2 releasing on September 3, 2025."

Gen. Eyal Zamir, Foreign Minister Gideon Saar and Director of the Government Press Office Nitzan Chen. Since October 7, Western media outlets have consistently downplayed the relentless assault on journalists, civil defense workers, UN employees, and, of course, the vulnerable civilian population in Gaza. This letter, along with its call for accountability, undoubtedly arrives too late. The Israeli double-strikes on a hospital in the southern Gaza Strip, which have killed at least 20 people, including five journalists, raise questions about Western media responsibility.\n\nThe consistent difference in the treatment of Palestinian and Israeli fatalities by the Western mainstream press has been documented and extensively analysed since the onset of the conflict, with findings indicating significant bias and inequality in their media coverage. The terminology used by Western mainstream media to portray the situation in Gaza is shockingly insensitive, intentionally crafted to mislead the public and perpetuate the disturbing dehumanisation of Palestinians. The coverage is so one-sided and in sync with Israel's narrative that it has led many to question whether the absence of empathy and concern for Palestinian journalists stems from the fact that the victims are neither American nor European. Nevertheless, there is a growing dissatisfaction within newsrooms, with journalists beginning to voice their concerns regarding media bias.\n\nToday, we are highlighting the story of Valerie Zink, a Canadian photojournalist who has recently left her position as a Reuters correspondent. She feels that the agency has supported Israel's propaganda and has not adequately defended her fallen colleagues in Gaza.\n\nTRT Globalreports...\n\nCanada photojournalist says Reuters culpable in Israel's assassination of 246 Gaza journalists\n\nValerie Zink says the agency enabled Israel's propaganda and failed to defend slain colleagues in Gaza\n\nCanadian photojournalist Valerie Zink announced on her personal Facebook page that she is resigning from Reuters news agency after eight years as a stringer, saying she can no longer work for an agency she accuses of \"justifying and enabling\" Israel's systematic killing of journalists in Gaza."

      "body": "President Donald J. Trump has promised 'dire consequences' for Big Pharma executives who lied about the dangers of COVID jabs, issuing a fiery Truth Social post this morning demanding Pfizer and other companies release their internal data while casting doubt on Operation Warp Speed's success amid revelations of severe health risks.\n\nTrump's remarks follow a weekend report exposing that Pfizer's COVID-19 shot plasmids contain three human DNA sequences capable of integrating into the genome -- specifically targeting blood, immune, and neurological systems, which align precisely with the injuries most commonly reported after vaccination. This explosive disclosure has fueled growing scrutiny of the vaccines' safety, prompting calls for accountability from those who fast-tracked their rollout without full transparency. As public outrage builds, Trump's stance positions him as a champion against corporate deception, potentially leading to investigations that could unravel Big Pharma's grip on health policy.\n\nModernity.news reports: The move also comes after Trump last month described Operation Warp Speed as an \"incredible\" accomplishment but stressed that it was \"a long time ago\" and that his team is now \"looking for other answers\" beyond mRNA shots -- remarks that drew frantic backlash from pro-vaccine loyalists.\n\nFurthermore, Trump's new Warp Speed doubts come after HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. formally rescinded the COVID shot Emergency Use Authorizations -- dismantling the very legal mechanism that enabled sweeping Biden-era mandates and marking the official end of the EUA-driven vaccine regime.\n\nMAHA Chief Medical Advisor Dr. Aseem Malhotra also recently revealed that the Trump administration is preparing to pull the COVID-19 mRNA shots from the U.S. market \"within months,\" citing overwhelming evidence of vaccine injury and pressure from those closest to Secretary Kennedy.\n\nFor millions who have been demanding Trump go further and pull the jab from the market, his latest statement is nothing short of a breakthrough -- proof that the calls for accountability are finally reaching the very top.\n\nTrump wrote in a Truth Social post this morning:\n\nTrump said he has been shown what he called \"extraordinary\" information from Pfizer and others, but complained that the companies refuse to share those results with the American public or even the CDC.\n\nHe pointed out the growing crisis of confidence in public health institutions.\n\nIn one of his most direct acknowledgments yet of the controversy surrounding the rushed vaccine rollout, Trump closed by openly questioning the legacy of his own administration's program:\n\nThere is an unmistakable string of actions already taken that point to the Trump administration potentially pulling the COVID injection:\n\nBottom Line\n\nTrump's statement marks his sharpest break yet from the uncritical praise of Operation Warp Speed.\n\nComing on the heels of his remarks distancing himself from mRNA, Dr. Malhotra's revelation that the Trump admin plans to pull the COVID-19 shot from the market \"within months,\" and Secretary Kennedy's rescission of the EUA that fueled Biden-era mandates, today's demand puts Big Pharma directly on notice.\n\nWhether Trump is preparing to disown Warp Speed outright and pull the mRNA shot from market, or simply testing the waters, his insistence that Pfizer and other drugmakers \"clear up this MESS\" signals a new phase in the battle over COVID vaccine accountability.\n\nWe may be witnessing the beginning of Trump's process of pulling the death-linked COVID-19 jab from the market once and for all, as I've recently predicted he might."

We cannot do what we do without your support.\n\nPresident Karol Nawrocki, who is aligned with Poland's right-wing opposition, is heading to the White House for a meeting with Donald Trump without any government representatives in his delegation.\n\nPoland's foreign ministry says this breaks with the previous practice of presidents, who are not part of the government, to include someone from the ministry in visits to Washington, given that the government is responsible for foreign policy.\n\nHowever, the head of Nawrocki's chancellery, Zbigniew Bogucki, denies that this has always happened in the past. He says that no one from the foreign ministry was invited because the government has poor relations with Washington and has \"disgraced itself\" with critical comments about Trump in the past.\n\nNawrocki, who took office early last month, will be in Washington on Wednesday for his first foreign trip as president. During his election campaign, he was supported by Trump, who met him in the Oval Office (pictured above) and whose national security advisor visited Poland to call on Poles to vote for Nawrocki.\n\nOn Monday, Wirtualna Polska, a leading news website, was the first to report that Nawrocki, who has regularly clashed with the more liberal and pro-European Union government, was breaking with tradition by not inviting anyone from the foreign ministry to join his delegation.\n\n\"The practice so far has been for a representative of the foreign ministry to participate in the president's meetings,\" the ministry told Wirtualna Polska, saying that this had also been the case when Nawrocki's predecessor, Andrzej Duda, who was also aligned with the opposition, was in office.\n\nThe ministry said that it had offered to send someone to join Nawrocki in Washington, even suggesting foreign minister Radosław Sikorski himself, \"but the president's office has not responded\".\n\nOn Wednesday, Bogucki confirmed to Polskie Radio that no one from the government would join the trip. This, he said, is because Nawrocki wants to \"restore good relations with the US, which this government lacks\".\n\n\"These people disgraced themselves,\" he added, referring to critical comments about Trump made by figures including Sikorski and Prime Minister Donald Tusk before the US president returned to office this year.\n\nBogucki added that there \"is no such custom\" for presidents to bring someone from the government with them to the White House. He claimed that, in the past, sometimes \"someone from the [foreign] ministry was there, but just as often they were not\".\n\nSikorski will in fact be in the US at the same time as Nawrocki, visiting Miami for talks with his American counterpart, Marco Rubio, with whom he will jointly present the Lech Wałęsa Solidarity Award to a Cuban opposition figure.\n\nBogucki today also criticised a recent letter sent by the foreign ministry to Nawrocki, in which it advised him on how to approach the talks with Trump. The contents of the letter were leaked to media outlet Kanał Zero last week.\n\nIn the document, the ministry advised the president to avoid making any commitments to further Polish arms purchases from the US, not to declare support for a US company to be the contractor for a planned second nuclear power plant in Poland, and to avoid discussing the government's plans for a new digital tax.\n\nBogucki said it was \"bizarre\" for a government that had such bad relations with Washington to \"try to dictate what the president should and should not say\". Nawrocki's spokesman, Rafał Leśkiewicz, likewise said that the letter should \"be treated as a joke\".\n\n\"If the American side raises this issue [of a digital tax], the president [Nawrocki] will certainly respond appropriately,\" added Bogucki. Trump has threatened punitive sanctions against countries that introduce such taxes, which would particularly impact US tech firms.\n\nIn response to the dispute, the spokesman for the foreign ministry, Paweł Wroński, warned that \"there cannot be two foreign policies serving one country\". However, he added that \"we wish President Nawrocki success during his visit to Washington\".\n\nOn Monday, Tusk also met with Nawrocki ahead of the White House trip to discuss the government's views. The prime minister said that while he \"does not want to impose any agenda\", he had \"confirmed to the president that the government's recommendations remain in effect\".\n\nMeanwhile, Sikorski published a video on social media in which he outlined that the government's main suggestions to Nawrocki were to \"explain Putin's true intentions in Ukraine\" to Trump and to \"avert a reduction of US military forces in Europe, and especially Poland\".\n\nPoland's constitution states that the government \"shall conduct the internal affairs and foreign policy of Poland\" and that \"the president shall cooperate with the prime minister and the appropriate minister in respect of foreign policy\".\n\nNawrocki's election has raised concerns that Poland's effectiveness on the international stage will diminish due to his conflict with the government, which has already seen him veto a series of bills passed by the ruling majority in parliament.\n\nThose were amplified last month when no Polish representative was invited to join other European leaders accompanying Volodymyr Zelensky for talks with Trump.\n\nNotes from Poland is run by a small editorial team and published by an independent, non-profit foundation that is funded through donations from our readers.

It will have an impact only if his clients and their supporters leave Mumbai and go out. Ganeshotsav is going on and thousands of people pin roads, and we have to maintain law and order also with police personnel\".\n\nThe High Court admonished the Attorney General, stating, \"You should have come to us on the very first day and stated that the number of people exceeded 5,000. You allowed this situation to reach this point. We will also pass an order against you, as you are in breach of our orders\".\n\nMeanwhile, earlier today, Mumbai Police personnel arrived at Azad Maidan to vacate the area following the Bombay High Court (HC) directives to stop the Maratha agitation.\n\nDCP Zone 1, Pravin Munde and other police officials arrive at Azad Maidan to vacate the area.\n\nMumbai Police issued a notice and denied permission to continue the Maratha agitation and ordered the protestors to vacate the Azad Maidan premises, citing violation of the terms and conditions laid out by the Bombay High Court and police to hold the protest.\n\nAfter Mumbai Police denied permission to continue the agitation, Maratha reservation activist Manoj Jarange Patil, who has been on a hunger strike for the last 5 days, said that even if he dies, he will not leave the protest site Azad Maidan.

The announcement, made on the fifth day of his indefinite fast at Azad Maidan in Mumbai, sparked jubilation among his supporters.\n\n\"We have won,\" Jarange told the protesters after his meeting with the sub-committee led by minister Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, accompanied by Shivendrasinh Bhosale, Uday Samant, and Manikrao Kokate. The panel discussed with Jarange the draft finalised by the government.\n\nJarange said his protest would be called off and he would leave Mumbai if the state issued government resolutions (GRs) on the agreed demands by Tuesday night. The committee assured that the Hyderabad Gazette will be implemented immediately, and caste certificates will be given to Marathas with Kunbi records after due inquiry. Implementation of the Satara Gazette, he added, will follow within a month.\n\nThe committee also promised withdrawal of cases filed against Maratha protesters by the end of September. Families of those who lost their lives during the agitation will receive government jobs and financial aid within a week, based on educational qualifications. According to Vikhe Patil, Rs 15 crore has already been disbursed to such families, with the remaining compensation to be cleared soon.\n\nOn the contentious issue of the 'sage soyare' (blood relatives) notification, Vikhe Patil revealed that nearly eight lakh objections have been received and are under scrutiny. He further said the government is exploring legal avenues to issue a GR equating Kunbis and Marathas as one community, a process that could take two months.\n\nJarange, who began his hunger strike on August 29 demanding 10 per cent reservation for Marathas in government jobs and education under the OBC category, called the acceptance of these key demands a \"people's victory.\" His declaration of success set off loud celebrations among protesters gathered at Azad Maidan."

This exhaustive account aims to hold Israel accountable on the international stage, urging global intervention while highlighting the human cost of the ongoing conflict, which has drawn widespread condemnation from human rights organizations.\n\nNaturalnews.com reports: The human rights organization's report paints a grim picture of life in Gaza, where the majority of the population has been forcibly displaced multiple times since October 2023. The report states that Israel's actions have led to the deaths of over 62,000 Palestinians, predominantly women and children, and have left the enclave in ruins.\n\nDirector of PCHR Raji Sourani emphasized the intentional nature of the destruction, stating, \"From the very first moment of the Israeli military aggression on the Gaza Strip on 7 October 2023, the intent to commit genocide was evident.\" Sourani highlighted that this intent was not only expressed through public statements by Israeli officials but also through the state's policies and their devastating impact on the Palestinian population.\n\nAccording to Brighteon.AI's Enoch, \"Voices of the Genocide\" is primarily based on testimonies from 1,225 Palestinians, exposing Israel's systemic human rights violations and war crimes against Palestinians as well as torture, extrajudicial killings and ethnic cleansing in Gaza as part of a broader Zionist agenda supported by Western elites.\n\nThe investigation found that Israeli forces deliberately targeted civilian areas, often without warning, resulting in the deaths of unarmed individuals, including those who attempted to surrender. The use of weapons like munitions that scatter widespread shrapnel and phosphorus gas has caused severe injuries and long-term health and environmental damage. The PCHR also documented the deliberate targeting of hospitals and medical infrastructure, which has deprived Palestinians of essential care. This has led to untreated injuries, worsening conditions and preventable deaths. The report further accuses Israel of using starvation and denial of essentials as a weapon, causing widespread suffering and death.\n\nAccording to the Genocide Convention, genocide is defined as five specific acts committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group. The report identifies the following acts as having been committed in Gaza:\n\nThe paper echoes conclusions by other leading human rights organizations, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. In December 2024, Amnesty International became the first to conclude that Israel had committed genocide during its war on Gaza, while Human Rights Watch found that genocidal acts had been committed.\n\nFrancesca Albanese, the UN's special rapporteur on Palestine, has authored reports suggesting that genocide is taking place in Gaza. Additionally, two major Israeli rights groups, B'Tselem and Physicians for Human Rights-Israel, have accused the Netanyahu government of genocidal acts and incitement.\n\nThe PCHR's report is a stark reminder of the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the urgent need for international intervention. As the evidence of genocide mounts, the global community faces a critical moment to uphold the principles of international law and human rights. The suffering of the Palestinian people demands immediate action to bring an end to the violence and ensure justice for the victims.\n\nIn the words of Sourani, \"Gaza should not, and will not, become the graveyard of international law.\""

She reassured citizens that there is no need to panic.\n\nGupta spent a significant amount of time in the affected localities and was briefed in detail by officials.

The Yamuna reached an all-time high of 208.66 metres on July 13, 2023.\n\nGupta explained that water entering the Yamuna floodplains is a natural occurrence, as it is the river's designated course. She reassured people that there was no risk of flooding in the outer areas.\n\nNoting that officials are providing her hourly updates, she assured people that the situation would be monitored continuously and relief operations would be underway till the floodwater recedes.\n\nGupta appealed to people to cooperate with the administration and follow the safety guidelines issued by the government.

      "body": "Hyderabad: Kalvakuntla Kavitha is a well-known name in both Telugu states. She is the daughter of BRS party chief and former CM KCR. With her expertise, she has made a mark in politics and carved a niche for herself in the BRS party.\n\nShe was earlier a BRS MP and is currently serving as an MLC. At a time when everything should have been fine, Kavitha's life took a stormy turn when the liquor scam case came to light. Suddenly, her political journey went haywire. In this case, she spent more than 100 days in Tihar Jail.\n\nThe BRS high command distanced itself from Kavitha. The party pushed her away but could not bring her back into the fold. From that time onwards, whatever Kavitha said or did became a sensation. Now, a political tsunami has erupted within the BRS, with party chief KCR taking a sensational decision -- suspending Kavitha from the party.\n\nIn a statement, the party said the decision came after long discussions and was based on the views of leaders and workers. The high command accused Kavitha of indulging in anti-party activities in recent days.\n\nSpeaking to the media on Monday, Kavitha made sensational comments, targeting former minister Harish Rao and former MP Santosh Rao. She alleged that both played a key role in the Kaleshwaram project, with CM Revanth Reddy protecting them. She further claimed that Harish Rao had a big role in the corruption surrounding Kaleshwaram, which was why he was removed from the post of Irrigation Minister. Kavitha also alleged that Harish and Santosh amassed huge assets by sidelining KCR.\n\nAccording to her, \"Harish Rao and Santosh Rao only want money, while KCR has been made a scapegoat between corruption and political conspiracy.\" She added that the situation worsened after the CBI investigation against KCR.\n\nMeanwhile, sources revealed that the BRS IT cell instructed party workers to immediately unfollow Kavitha on social media. Soon after, many unfollowed her on X (formerly Twitter) and began posting critical comments. BRS leaders speaking on TV debates also strongly condemned her behavior. Some blamed her working style for the party's humiliating defeat in the last elections, while others demanded that she resign as MLC. Her PRO was even removed from the BRSLP WhatsApp group.\n\nEarlier, Kavitha was arrested by the CBI and ED in connection with the Delhi liquor scam case. After spending over 100 days in jail, she was released on bail granted by the Supreme Court. During her imprisonment, leaders including KTR, Harish Rao, and Santosh Rao had visited her to express solidarity. Following her release, she received a grand welcome in Delhi.\n\nHowever, the turning point came when Kavitha started organizing meetings and rallies under the banner of Telangana Jagruti without informing the BRS high command. She raised the BC slogan and openly criticized the then BRS government, saying: \"During 10 years of BRS rule, there was no social justice.\"\n\nTensions escalated further during the BRS Silver Jubilee celebrations in Hanumakonda's Elkaturthi, where party leaders and workers from across the state gathered. While the venue was decorated with banners highlighting KTR's leadership, Kavitha's photo was completely missing. This exclusion reportedly left her deeply upset, marking a clear sign of growing rifts within the party."

Recording this submission, a division bench comprising Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi did not pass any order on a plea seeking extension to the September 1 deadline.\n\nThe bench also requested the chairman of the Bihar State Legal Services Authority to depute para legal volunteers to assist electors and political parties in submitting online claims, objections or corrections to the electoral roll. This, the bench observed, was done to tackle the \"unfortunate trust deficit\" in ECI by a few electors and political parties.\n\nThe bench further ordered that each para legal volunteer will then submit a confidential report to the chairman to the District Legal Services Authority. \"This information so collected from the PLV may be collated at the level of State Legal Services Authority for further consideration,\" the bench further ordered. The counsel for ECI submitted that the commission has received more claims/objections for \"exclusion\" from the draft roll than for \"inclusion\". As regards RJD's application seeking extension of the deadline, the ECI counsel argued that their only grievance was that the objections filed by them have not been shown in their names."
